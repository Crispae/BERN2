This study describes the development and validation of a tool to measure the Medical Home. The Medical Home Index (MHI) consists of 25 themes arranged among 6 domains of primary care office activity. A national panel of experts on the Medical Home reviewed a prototype of the instrument. Pediatric primary care offices completed the MHI and participated in 90-minute on-site interviews with two of the authors (J.W.M., K.S.). The study examined interrater reliability between the 2 project staff and between the practices and project staff and the internal consistency of MHI domains and themes. On a 100-point scale, 43 practices demonstrated a range of MHI summary scores from 18.9 to 75.4, with a mean of 43.9. Kappa coefficients of interrater reliability between two Center for Medical Home Improvement project staff were above.50 for all 25 themes. Kappa scores comparing each staff member and the practice sites' self-assessment found 80% of the themes at.65 or better for one interviewer (J.W.M.) and 60% of the themes at.65 or better for the second interviewer (K.S.). Intraclass correlation coefficients between the summary scores of the interviewers were.98 and between the scores of the two interviewers and the scores of the practices was.97. The internal consistency reliability standardized alpha coefficients across the 6 domains of the MHI ranged from.81 to.91, and the overall standardized alpha coefficient was.96. In the sample of practices studied, the MHI was an internally consistent instrument with acceptable reliability and validity for pediatric primary care practices to assess their implementation of the Medical Home concept. Further work is needed to study its correlation with other process and outcome measures and its performance in a wider range of practices."}

Multiple regression analysis was used to derive models for serum CRP concentrations in terms of the other variables measured. Although CRP was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), percent fat mass, and serum leptin, correlations with BMI (r = 0.15, P =.05) and percent body fat (r = 0.16, P =.003) were not as strong as the correlation with leptin (r = 0.28, P =.0002). CRP was also associated with resting heart rate (r = 0.14, P =.05), heart-rate corrected QT (QTc) interval (r = 0.22, P =.003) and several components of the insulin resistance (IR) syndrome. CRP showed a strong and negative association with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (r = -0.26, P =.0005) and a marginal and positive association with triglyceride (r = 0.14, P =.05). Although CRP was associated with fasting insulin (r = 0.15, P =.04), it was not related to serum adiponectin or IR index estimated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). Multiple regression analysis indicated that serum CRP was positively related to serum leptin (P =.003) and QTc interval (P =.01), and negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol (P =.01, R(2) = 0.15). In young, apparently healthy men, serum leptin but not BMI was independently associated with serum CRP, suggesting that amount of body fat may be the most significant predictor of CRP. Although low-grade inflammation was associated with long QTc interval and low HDL-cholesterol, the mechanism underlying these associations is an important question to be addressed."}

Conjunctival biopsy specimens were obtained from nine patients with active VKC and 6 normal control subjects. The presence and distribution of tenascin, laminin, and fibronectin were assessed microscopically with immunohistochemical techniques and a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against tenascin, laminin, and fibronectin. In normal conjunctiva, weak immunoreactivity for tenascin was localized to the walls of blood vessels in the upper substantia propria. Weak immunoreactivity for laminin was located at the epithelial-stromal junction and in the walls of blood vessels. Staining for fibronectin was absent. In VKC specimens, intense immunoreactivity for tenascin was noted in the substantia propria associated with the inflammatory infiltrate and in the perivascular stroma. Intense immunoreactivity for laminin around all stromal vessels and fibrillar immunoreactivity among basal epithelial cells were noted. There was no immunoreactivity for fibronectin. Our data indicate increased deposition of tenascin and laminin in the conjunctiva from patients with active VKC. Our findings suggest that tenascin and laminin might play distinct roles in chronic inflammation seen in VKC."}

Eighteen children with Legg-Perthes-Calve disease were operated on between 1992 and 2001. Mean age at diagnosis was 7 years 2 months, and mean age at surgery was 8 years 5 months (range 5-13 years). Mean motion was limited -25 degrees in abduction and internal rotation preoperatively. The radiological classification was: 2 Catterall II Herring B with signs of risk for the head, 8 IIB, 1 III C, 2 IV B, 3 IV C, and 2 at the sequelar stage. Mean excentration was 6.5 mm and mean overhang was 10.2 mm. The indication for surgery was aggravation of the excentration or advanced revascularization. An iliac graft was embedded in the supralimbic and covered with a rectus femoris tendon which, left continuous, provided elastic support. A bermuda cast was used in 17 cases and immediate weight-bearing in 11. The patients were hospitalized 36 hours. Sixteen patients were reviewed at mean follow-up of 3 years 2 months (2 lost to follow-up). There were no complications. Clinically, the patients were pain free. Three patients had persistent limping 10 moderate limitation of motion, and three had severe stiffness. Radiologically, head covering was good in 15 cases, and joint congruency was achieved in 15 (11 of which were concentric). Shelf acetabuloplasty was considered useful in 12 cases, not useful in 1 after complete lysis of a poorly positioned graft, and of uncertain usefulness in 3 (including 2 cases treated at the sequalar stage). Femoral osteotomy for varisation and pelvic osteotomy for reorientation or enlargement of the acetabulum are effective but have certain drawbacks (limitation of abduction, leg length discrepancy, reintervention to remove material). The excellent integration of the shelf graft at mid-term is a good sign of correct head-acetabulum adaptation, with radiological and clinical results similar to other techniques. Joint stiffness and limping are observed in very severe forms where the prognosis depends on the stage of the disease. The patients in this series have not yet all reached maturity. Shelf plasty is a rapid, easily-performed, and safe means of enabling weight-bearing in Legg-Perthes-Calve hips undergoing excentration and beginning revascularization."}

Leaving behind as much skin as is possible significantly improves the natural appearance of the reconstruction and reduces procedures required on the contralateral breast to achieve symmetry. SSM with immediate reconstruction offers superior aesthetic results to NSSM, with similar LR rates. As most recurrences will occur in chest wall skin, the ability to detect local recurrence is not impaired. The incidence of local wound complications with SSM is comparable to NSSM. It has been demonstrated that sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary dissection can be performed adequately in SSM. There is no contraindication to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. There are some groups of patients for whom SSM is not indicated, such as patients with inflammatory carcinoma. SSM should be considered for selected patients with breast cancer in conjunction with all types of immediate reconstruction. In conclusion, numerous studies support the use of SSM on selected patients as an oncologically acceptable procedure with superior cosmetic results when compared with traditional NSSM."}

In this cross-sectional study, 403 subjects were selected by random sampling, including 145 men and 151 women aged 25-50 years and 57 men and 50 women over 50 years old in the framework of Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS). Height, body weight, waist and hip circumferences were measured, and the body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. Mean energy requirements for each sex-age group were estimated by multiplying specific coefficients (allocated to each group) by body weight and resting energy expenditure (REE), and the results of both methods were compared with mean energy values recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. recommended dietary allowance (RDA). Dietary assessment was performed by 48-hour diet recall. A ratio of energy intake to basal metabolic rate lower than 1.27 was considered as under-reporting. Physical activity was evaluated by standard questionnaire of the Lipid Research Clinics (LRC). Women were significantly more overweight and obese than men (p < 0.001) and older women were more obese than younger ones (p < 0.05). Only one-third of the study population had adequate physical activity. Women had significantly lower physical activity than men (p < 0.01). Energy requirements for both age and sex groups were lower than recommended daily allowances for energy: men 25-50; 2576 vs. 2900; men > 50: 2155 vs. 2300; women 20-50: 2045 vs. 2200 and women > 50: 1817 vs. 1900 kilocalories (kcal). Reported energy intake of men was higher and that of women was lower than the RDA. Forty percent of women and 14% of men under-reported their energy intake. The energy requirement of the average Tehranian is lower than daily allowances; conditions of obesity and overweight are more prevalent in women. There is high frequency of under-reporting of energy intake in women. Lifestyle modifications to improve dietary habits and to increase physical activity are recommended to decrease overweight and obesity in urban population of Tehran."}

It consisted of a prospective and descriptive study involving six basic health centres in Sousse and was conducted over the course of 30 randomly selected days during the year 2000. There were 4022 consultations included in the study which were described according to the SOAP plan. The coding of the charted diagnoses was carried out according to the International Classification of Primary Care (CISP). There were 98% of the consultants who were self-referred and 84% of the consultations corresponded to new cases. The consultants' sex-ratio was 0.5 in favour of females with an average age of 27 years. There were 4,597 diagnoses noted utilising 336 codes from the CISP classification system. The \"Respiratory\" chapter took the first place on the list (39.6%) followed by the \"Circulatory\" chapter. The \"Top 30\" list of the most often charted diagnoses totaled 72% of the consultations among which the three most frequent health problems were pharyngitis (14.4%), acute bronchitis (8.3%) and arterial hypertension (7.4%). This study demonstrates that the practice of general medicine is characterised by instinctive first solutions and versatility. The predominance of cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses illustrates the double burden of morbidity which is faced by Tunisian general medicine practitioners. The \"Top 30\" list should serve as basis for planning pregraduate and continuing medical training."}

From February 1996 to August 2001, 24 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (12 idiopathic, 12 ischemic) underwent PLV. Perioperative and follow-up data were prospectively entered into a database and analyzed. An observational analysis of the literature was carried out of all the published series of PLV reporting on > or =15 patients. In our series there were 22 males with amean age of 65 years (range 49 to73). Of the 22, there were 3 (12.5%) in-hospital deaths. Mean duration of follow-up was 26 months (range 3 to 71) with 9 late deaths (38%), 6 in the idiopathic group. The five-year actuarial survival was 74% in the ischemic group and 33% in the idiopathic group. The observational analysis of literature included a total of 506 patients (425 males, age 50.2 +/- 5.2 years)]. The etiology was idiopathic in 255 (50.4%), and ischemic in 89 (17.6%) patients. Baseline characteristics of the whole population include: ejection fraction 18.9 +/- 3.9%, NYHA functional class 3.7 +/- 0.2, and LVEDD of 7.7 +/- 0.4 cm. Severe mitral regurgitation was present in 368 (72.7%) patients. There were 88 (17.4%) in-hospital deaths. Cause of death included 55 due to (62.5%) low cardiac output, 10 (11.3%) due to severe bleeding, 7 (7.95%) caused by malignant arrhythmias, 8 (9%) due to sepsis, and 5 (5.7%) as a result of stroke. Ten of the selected series (overall 386 patients) reported late outcome. There were 89 (22.9%) late deaths, 12 (13.5%) were not cardiac-related, 50 (56.2%) were due to recurrence of congestive heart failure (CHF), 20 (22.5%) caused by sudden arrhythmias, 5 (5.6%) due to infections, and 2 (2.2%) from strokes. Overall, there were 248 (64.2%) survivors, of whom 179 (72.17%) were reported to be in NYHA functional class I or II. All 10 papers reported one-year survival ranging from 50% to 85%. Seven reported a two-year survival of 45% to 72%, and 4 reported a three-year survival of 33% to 64%. Our results and the review of the literature seem to suggest a relatively high early mortality with satisfactory late results of PLV in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy."}

The lateral superior olive (LSO) contains the cell bodies of lateral olivocochlear neurons. Melittin, a cytotoxic chemical, was injected into the brain stem using stereotaxic coordinates and near-field evoked potentials to target the LSO. Brain stem histology revealed discrete damage to the LSO following the injections. Functional consequences of this damage were reflected in depressed amplitude of the compound action potential of the eighth nerve (CAP) following the lesion. Threshold sensitivity and N1 latencies were relatively unchanged. Onset adaptation of the cubic distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) was evident, suggesting a reasonably intact medial efferent system. The present results provide the first report of functional changes induced by isolated manipulation of the lateral efferent pathway. They also confirm the suggestion that changes in single-unit auditory nerve activity after cutting the olivocochlear bundle are probably a consequence of disrupting the more lateral of the two olivocochlear efferent pathways."}

Enantiomer ratios that deviate from 1:1 in the environment provide evidence for the preferential microbial degradation of one enantiomer, whereas ER values equal to 1 provide no evidence for microbial degradation and may mistakenly be interpreted as evidence that biodegradation is not important. In an attempt to link biological and geochemical information related to enantioselective processes, we measured the ERs of the chiral pesticide alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) and bacterial activity (normalized to abundance) in surface waters of the York River (VA, USA) bimonthly throughout one year. Despite lower overall alpha-HCH concentrations, alpha-HCH ER values were unexpectedly close to 1:1 in the freshwater region of the estuary with the highest bacterial activity. In contrast, ER values were nonracemic (ER double dagger 1) and alpha-HCH concentrations were significantly higher in the higher salinity region of the estuary, where bacterial activity was lower. Examination of these data may indicate that racemic environmental ER values are not necessarily reflective of a lack of biodegradation or recent input into the environment, and that nonenantioselective biodegradation may be important in certain areas."}

These channels can be distinguished by their sensitivity to Ca2+ channel blockers 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SK&F 96365) and (R,S)-(3,4-dihydro-6,7-dimethoxy-isochinolin-1-yl)-2-phenyl-N,N-di[2-(2,3,4-trimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]acetamid mesylate (LOE 908). NSCC-1 is sensitive to LOE 908 and resistant to SK&F 96365; NSCC-2 is sensitive to both blockers, and SOCC is resistant to LOE 908 and sensitive to SK&F 96365. In this study, we examined the mechanism of ET-1-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release. Both SK&F 96365 and LOE 908 inhibited ET-1-induced AA release with the IC50 values correlated to those of ET-1-induced Ca2+ influx. Moreover, combined treatment with these blockers abolished ET-1-induced AA release. Wortmannin and LY294002, inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), partially inhibited ET-1-induced AA release. LOE 908, but not SK&F 96365, inhibited ET-1-induced AA release in wortmannin-treated CHO-ETAR. ET-1 also induced AA release in CHO cells expressing ETAR truncated at the carboxyl terminal downstream of Cys385 (CHO-ETARDelta385) or an unpalmitoylated (Cys383 Cys385-388--> Ser383Ser385-388) ETAR (CHO-SerETAR), each of which is coupled with Gq or Gs/G12, respectively. In CHO-SerETAR, a dominant-negative mutant of G12 inhibited AA release. SK&F 96365 inhibited ET-1-induced AA release in CHO-ETARDelta385, whereas LOE 908 inhibited it in CHO-SerETAR. These results indicate the following: 1) ET-1-induced AA release depends on Ca2+ influx through NSCC-1, NSCC-2, and SOCC in CHO-ETAR; 2) Gq and G12 mediate AA release through ETAR in CHO cells; and 3) PI3K is involved in ET-1-induced AA release, which depends on NSCC-2 and SOCC."}

The physical and reflex developmental parameters, open-field, plus-maze, social interaction, forced swimming, catalepsy and stereotyped behaviors, as well as striatal, cortical and hypothalamic monoamine levels (at 140 days of age) were measured. Maternal and offspring body weights were unaffected by exposure to the different doses of the AQE. High postnatal mortality, smaller size at Day 1 of life, reversible hyperflexion of the carpal joints and delay in the opening of both ears and in negative geotaxis were observed in the offspring exposed to the higher dose of AQE. At 60 and 90 days of age, open-field locomotion frequency was quite different between 0.0 and animals treated with 0.7 and 3.0 mg/kg AQE. No changes were observed in the plus-maze, social interaction, forced swimming, catalepsy, stereotyped behavior and central nervous system monoamines concentrations. Dams treated with the higher AQE dose showed severe cytoplasmic vacuolation in liver, kidney, pancreas and thyroid tissues, in contrast to the mild vacuolation observed in the other experimental groups. No alterations were observed in the histopathological study of the offspring of all experimental groups at 140 days of age. During adulthood, behavior was not modified in offspring exposed to the higher dose of AQE as well as no changes occurred in central nervous system neurotransmitters.

After clamping the afferent vessels around the right and caudal liver lobes, pCAGGS-luciferase, which was diluted with one of several osmotic pressure solutions, or pCAGGS-green fluorescence protein (GFP) plasmid was injected into these lobes to keep the efferent vessels patent. Electrical pulses were applied to the liver graft during cold preservation in lactated Ringer's solution, University of Wisconsin solution, and histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution. Transfection efficacy was estimated by measurement of luciferase activity. Luciferase activity in the liver was dependent on both the voltage and electric current of the electrical pulse, and also on the type of preservation solution and plasmid osmotic pressure. Luciferase activity was noted only in plasmid-injected lobes of the liver graft. GFP-transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence. GFP was observed predominantly in perivascular cells, including hepatocytes.

All women were participants in a breastfeeding peer-support project, and for most the peer volunteers represented their only source of support and guidance, outside of that provided by health professionals. Women often went to great lengths to avoid having to breastfeed in public, and the majority preferred to breastfeed away from the public gaze. Despite reported increases in breastfeeding rates, bottle-feeding remains the cultural norm in the more deprived areas of Glasgow. Those women who do breastfeed in these areas demonstrate a high level of commitment to breastfeeding that sets them apart from their social peers."}

Data so far presented in the literature were not sufficient to solve all the ambiguities in chromosome identification. Several genomic Norway spruce DNA clones containing highly repetitive sequences have been identified and characterised in our laboratory. Three of them were selected for fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments because of their strong signals and suitability for chromosome identification: PATR140 hybridized at the centromeric site of three chromosome pairs; PAF1 hybridized in six subtelomeric and two centromeric sites; 1PABCD6 co-localized with the subtelomeric sites identified by PAF1. The statistical analysis of microscopic measurements of chromosomes in combination with the FISH signals of these probes allowed the unambiguous construction of Norway spruce karyotype. We also compared the karyotype of Norway spruce with that of other spruce species to infer the number and kind of rearrangements that have occurred during the evolution of these species."}

The drug resistance of tumor cell is often companied with the enhanced expression of DNA repair genes. Down-regulation of DNA repair capacity by antisense strategy can increase the drug sensitivity of tumor cells. The aim of this study was to construct the eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA-XPB/AS (XPB: xeroderma pigmentosum B) and to investigate the function of XPB gene and its roles in chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity in lung cancer A549 cell. The XPB cDNA (69-520 bp) fragment amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was inserted into pcDNA3.1/His plasmid with an inverted orientation. The recombinant plasmid was transiently transfected into A549 cells. The Adriamycin-induced DNA damage was compared between the transfected and the untransfected cells by single cell gel electrophoresis assay (SCGE). The cellular sensitivity to Adriamycin of the transfected and the untransfected cells was determined by MTT assay. The successful construction of antisense plasmid was proved by restriction map and sequence analysis. RT-PCR results showed that the XPB mRNA expression was inhibited in transfected A549 cells. SCGE showed that the cellular damage repair ability induced by 4.0 microg/ml Adriamycin was suppressed in transfected cells. MTT assay showed the sensitivity of the transfected cells to Adriamycin was different from the untransfected cells but without statistical meaning. The antisense plasmid constructed by the authors can down-regulate the expression of XPB mRNA in the transfected cells and inhibit the cellular DNA damage repair ability, providing a basis to further study the gene function of XPB."}

We sought to compare the outcome of salvage treatment for patients with chest wall recurrence (CWR) according to initial disease stage to shed light on the potential benefit of PMRT in specific subgroups of patients. We retrospectively reviewed information concerning 96 patients with CWR who were not previously treated with PMRT. The patients were divided according to their initial extent of disease: T1-T2N0 (Group 1), T1-T2 with 1-3 positive lymph nodes (Group 2), and T3-T4 or > or =4 positive lymph nodes (Group 3). The OS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) from the time of CWR were compared using the method of Kaplan and Meier, and a Cox regression model was used for a multivariate analysis. Group 1 had an improved OS and DMFS compared with Group 2 and Group 3 (p < 0.001), but there were no differences in OS or DMFS between Group 2 and Group 3 (p = 0.250 and p = 0.492, respectively). The respective 5-year rates for the three groups were as follows: OS 79.9% vs. 41.9% vs. 29.1%; DMFS 75.2% vs. 33.6% vs. 25.9%. Breast cancer patients with T1-T2N0 breast cancer who develop a CWR have a significantly better outcome than those with lymph node-positive disease. Patients with T1-T2 tumors and one to three positive lymph nodes have a similar outcome after CWR as those with larger tumors or more than four positive lymph nodes. These data should be considered when weighing the risks and benefits of PMRT for patients with Stage II breast cancer with one to three positive lymph nodes."}

It was found that the pock-forming ability of the virus was not decreased after bombardment with electrons penetrating 100 A beneath the virus surface. There was very slight reduction in titer with large doses of electrons penetrating 330 A, but a sudden marked drop in infectivity occurred after exposure to electrons penetrating 500 to 700 A. Electrons of higher energies, including those capable of penetrating the virus particle completely, did not produce significant further fall in infectivity titer. It is concluded that a highly radiation-sensitive unit essential for pock formation is situated 500 to 700 A beneath the surface of the virus particle, possibly in the form of a shell. The relation of this finding to the known structure of the virus and to other radiation data on the dimensions of the infectious unit is discussed."}

When dealing with critically ill neonates with lethal conditions, it may be necessary to institute healing measures at the beginning of life. In such cases, healing measures must incorporate customary palliative measures but should not be limited to them. The purpose of this paper is to describe two families' approaches to palliation at the end of life in their newborn infants with Trisomy 18, a genetic abnormality usually associated with a markedly decreased life expectancy. We shall consider the concepts of interference versus intervention as we examine subtle medical differences between the two cases. We will address medical, legal, and ethical issues in each case, but special attention will be given to the provision of compassionate care. People face physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual challenges as they go through life. The families' approaches with their infants at the end of their lives may support the premise that the latter two challenges, emotional and spiritual, confront us the most at the end. Encouraging families to engage with their dying infants helps detoxify the experience and make it more meaningful."}

An accurate assessment of the presence of residual disease is essential to determine which patients would benefit from additional therapy. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET in detecting residual disease or relapse during the posttherapy period in patients with HD in comparison with CT. We also established different predictive values for (18)F-FDG PET according to the time interval between the end of therapy and the PET study. Forty-eight patients with HD underwent (18)F-FDG PET after the completion of chemotherapy (median, 58 d) between March 1999 and April 2002. Disease-free intervals and proportions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Standardized uptake values of the most active lesion in each patient with a positive study were also measured. PET and CT results were compared with clinical follow-up, with relapse being defined by a positive biopsy or the introduction of a second-line treatment. Thirty-four patients were still disease-free during a mean follow-up of 605 d. Fourteen patients relapsed during a mean follow-up of 197 d. The sensitivity and specificity of (18)F-FDG PET to predict relapse were 79% and 97%, respectively. The positive predictive value and the negative predictive value were both equal to 92%. The diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET (92%) was significantly higher than the accuracy of CT (56%) (P < 0.0005). Patients with positive (18)F-FDG PET also had a far shorter median disease-free interval (79 d) than those with positive CT (disease-free proportion of 52% at 1,143 d) (P = 0.0046). The 3 cases of false-negative (18)F-FDG PET studies that we observed occurred in patients who underwent their PET study within the first 49 d after the end of chemotherapy. Positive (18)F-FDG PET after the end of therapy in HD patients is a strong predictor of relapse. A negative PET study is also an excellent predictor of good prognosis. The diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET to assess the presence of residual disease after therapy is superior to that of CT."}

In addition to standard laboratory methods, HemoCue is authorized for screening and diagnostic purposes in Germany. The rapid development of other glucose meters makes it necessary to re-evaluate this recommendation. Our objective was to test the usefulness of glucose meters in screening pregnant patients for gestational diabetes. The 50-g glucose challenge test was administered to one hundred and ninety-three pregnant patients whose blood glucose levels were then simultaneously measured with five portable meters and the HemoCue. The results were compared to our standard method (Hexokinase). A cut-off of 7.8 mmol/L was used and sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, the Youden index, and the Kappa index were calculated. The tests were performed by well-trained personnel (C.D. and U.S.). 1212 measurements were performed on 193 patients. All glucose meters showed a very good correlation (r > 0.90). None of the measurements showed an extreme deviation necessitating the error grid analysis. The GlucoTouch (5.93% +/- 7.4) and the HemoCue (-9.04% +/- 5.9) showed a mean deviation greater than 5%. None of the meters had a mean deviation greater than 10%. The accuracy fluctuated between 0.85 and 0.94. The Kappa index was between 66 to 85. In our clinical trial, the Accu-Chek, Glucotouch, OneTouch, and Precision demonstrated greater accuracy and a higher Kappa index than the HemoCue. Our data showed good concordance in statistical and clinical parameters for most of the six glucose meters. The HemoCue, recommended as a standard method in several countries, did not show better concordance than most of the tested glucose meters. When used by well-trained personnel, the accuracy of the Accu-Chek, Glucotouch, One-Touch, and Precision was acceptable for use in gestational diabetes screening."}

RT-PCR shows HGF isoforms are differently regulated between chondrocytes and Ob. A paracrine cross-talk between subchondral bone and cartilage may occur during OA. Recently, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been identified by immunohistochemistry in cartilage and more particularly in the deep zone of human osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage. By investigating HGF expression in cartilage, we found that chondrocytes did not express HGF; however, they expressed the two truncated isoforms, namely HGF/NK1 and HGF/NK2. Because the only other cells localized near the deep zone are osteoblasts from the subchondral bone plate, we hypothesized that they were expressing HGF. Indeed, we found that HGF was synthesized by osteoblasts from the subchondral bone plate. Moreover, OA osteoblasts produced five times more HGF than normal osteoblasts and almost no HGF/NK1, unlike normal osteoblasts. Because prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 are involved in OA progression, we investigated whether these factors impact HGF produced by normal osteoblasts. PGE2 was the only factor tested that was able to stimulate HGF synthesis. However, the addition of NS398, a selective inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) had no effect on HGF produced by OA osteoblasts. HGF/NK2 had a moderate stimulating effect on HGF production by normal osteoblasts, whereas osteocalcin was not modulated by either HGF or HGF/NK2. When investigating signaling routes that might be implicated in OA osteoblast-produced HGF, we found that protein kinase A was at least partially involved. In summary, this study raises the hypothesis that the HGF found in articular cartilage is produced by osteoblasts, diffuses into the cartilage, and may be implicated in the OA process."}

Coagulation pathway activation in models of hepatic fibrosis suggests variation in coagulation pathway components may influence the rate of fibrosis. We hypothesised that polymorphisms of the coagulation factors II and V affect the rate of progression to cirrhosis in HCV infected subjects. We studied the relationship between rate of fibrosis (calculated by dividing the fibrosis stage by duration of infection) and genotypes of specific coagulation pathway genes in 352 White European patients infected with HCV. Genotyping was performed using reverse line blot hybridisation. The rate of fibrosis was significantly higher in patients with the factor V Leiden genotype (Arg560Gln) (ANOVA, p=0.004). In disease association studies, a significant association was seen (Fisher's exact test, p=0.029; odds ratio 3.28 for fast progression to cirrhosis (expected to reach cirrhosis in less than 30 years) if heterozygous for factor V Leiden). No associations were seen between factor II genotype and fibrosis rate. Possession of the factor V Leiden polymorphism significantly increases the risk of rapid disease progression in HCV, suggesting a role for the coagulation system in the pathogenesis of fibrotic liver disease."}

The resulting accumulation of debris in the subretinal space leads to a progressive loss of photoreceptors. The defect results from a mutation in the Mertk gene, which is normally expressed in the RPE. Mertk is a receptor tyrosine kinase, involved in the binding of photoreceptor debris. Mutations in MERTK have also been described in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Here we demonstrate that subretinal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the murine Mertk gene can significantly prolong photoreceptor cell survival in the RCS rat. Electroretinographic analysis of treated eyes showed that functional photoreceptors were still present at 9 weeks, when there is virtually no activity in untreated control eyes. Histological analysis of treated eyes revealed a decrease in the amount of debris in the subretinal space, suggesting that RPE function was restored. Moreover, 9 weeks after treatment the number of photoreceptors was 2.5-fold higher in treated than in control eyes. This study provides strong support for the development of AAV-mediated gene therapy for RP caused by mutations in the MERTK gene."}

Congenital CMV is the most common cause of nonhereditary sensorineural hearing loss in children, and progressive hearing loss is common. To arrest the natural progression of congenital CMV, children referred to our center were treated with a prolonged course of ganciclovir. Medical records of children with congenital CMV who were treated with ganciclovir were reviewed to tabulate their presenting symptoms, duration of treatment, audiologic and developmental assessments and complications. We treated nine children with symptomatic CMV with iv ganciclovir at a median age of 10 days (range, 3 days to 11 months). Findings at diagnosis included microcephaly (five of nine); petechiae (five of nine); thrombocytopenia (seven of nine); and intracranial calcifications (six of eight). Hearing loss was noted before therapy in five of nine. The median duration of iv and subsequent oral ganciclovir was 1 year and 0.83 year, respectively. Median follow-up was 2 years (range, 1 to 7 years). No child had progression of hearing loss; improvement occurred in two. Seven children had at least one complication of ganciclovir therapy: central venous catheter/site infection (six); catheter malfunction (three); and neutropenia (one). Of nine children none treated with ganciclovir for congenital CMV had detectable progressive hearing loss. Complications associated with iv therapy occurred frequently. Currently available oral analogues of ganciclovir may facilitate earlier and more prolonged therapy for children with symptomatic congenital CMV and should be subjected to randomized controlled trials."}

Generation of spermidine or homospermidine from deoxyhypusine by deoxyhypusine synthase.", "abstract": "Deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes the first step in hypusine (N epsilon-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine) synthesis in a single cellular protein, eIF5A precursor. The synthesis of deoxyhypusine catalyzed by this enzyme involves transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to a specific lysine residue in the eIF5A precursor protein to form a deoxyhypusine-containing eIF5A intermediate, eIF5A(Dhp). We recently discovered the efficient reversal of deoxyhypusine synthesis. When eIF5A([3H]Dhp), radiolabeled in the 4-aminobutyl portion of its deoxyhypusine residue, was incubated with human deoxyhypusine synthase, NAD, and 1,3-diaminopropane, [3H]spermidine was formed by a rapid transfer of the radiolabeled 4-aminobutyl side chain of the [3H]deoxyhypusine residue to 1,3-diaminopropane. No reversal was observed with [3H]hypusine protein, suggesting that hydroxylation at the 4-aminobutyl side chain of the deoxyhypusine residue prevents deoxyhypusine synthase-mediated reversal of the modification. Purified human deoxyhypusine synthase also exhibited homospermidine synthesis activity when incubated with spermidine, NAD, and putrescine. Thus it was found that [14C]putrescine can replace eIF5A precursor protein as an acceptor of the 4-aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to form radiolabeled homospermidine. The Km value for putrescine (1.12 mM) as a 4-aminobutyl acceptor, however, is much higher than that for eIF5A precursor (1.5 microM). Using [14C]putrescine as an acceptor, various spermidine analogs were evaluated as donor substrates for human deoxyhypusine synthase. Comparison of spermidine analogs as inhibitors of deoxyhypusine synthesis, as donor substrates for synthesis of deoxyhypusine (or its analog), and for synthesis of homospermidine (or its analog) provides new insights into the intricate specificity of this enzyme and versatility of the deoxyhypusine synthase reaction."}

The contamination by phthalates such as dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in 23 arable soils throughout China was investigated to evaluate the present pollution situation. The survey results demonstrated that phthalates were ubiquitous pollutants in soils in China. The total concentrations of phthalates differed from one location to another, and ranged from 0.89 to 10.03 mg kg(-1) with a median concentration of 3.43 mg kg(-1). Among the phthalates, DEHP was dominant and detected in all 23 soils. DEP and DBP were also in abundance, and DMP was rarely detected. Similar contamination patterns were observed in all 23 soils. A distinct feature of phthalate pollution in China was that the average concentration in northern China was higher than that in southern China. In addition, a close relationship was observed between the concentration of phthalates in soils and the consumption of agricultural film. The correlation showed that the application of agriculture film might be a significant pollution source of phthalates in arable soils of China. The potential risk of phthalates in soils was assessed on the basis of current guide values and limits."}

Depth was not found to make a significant contribution to eye distances in an idealized system where the real-world coordinates of points on the eye were known from three-dimensional calibration of stereo photographs. However, the differences found between measurements taken from single frontal photographs and those from stereo-photogrammetry indicated that measurements from single photographs are prone to errors due to misalignment of the camera, the face, and the calibration instrument during image acquisition; if single photographs are to be used, the placement of these components should be carefully monitored."}

Individuals in this cluster also had histories of delinquency and high rates of substance-related disorder. In comparison, the MPQ profile of the internalizing cluster was characterized by lower Positive Emotionality, Alienation, and Aggression and higher Constraint, and individuals in this cluster showed high rates of depressive disorder.

A cannula was placed in the esophagus of anesthetized Wistar rats with the tip approximately 2 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Hydrochloric acid (0.1 N HCl, 50 mmol/L) with pepsin (3,200-4,500 U/mL), at pH 1.6, was then perfused into the esophagi of the experimental rats (n = 8) at 10 mL/hr continuously for 50 minutes. Normal saline solution (0.9% NaCl) was used in control rats (n = 6), and home cage control animals (n = 6) were given no stimulation. Thirty minutes after the perfusion, the rat was killed and the brain was removed and processed for c-Fos immunohistochemistry. A transverse section of the esophagus, 2 cm above the LES, was stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain for light microscopy. c-Fos immunoreactivity was significantly increased in a number of brain regions in the rats receiving the acid plus pepsin perfusion. These areas included the central amygdala, the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the medial part of the NTS, the interstitial part of the NTS, the commissural part of the NTS, the paratrigeminal nucleus, the ambiguus nucleus, and the rostroventrolateral recticular nucleus. Perfusion with acid-pepsin solution also resulted in morphologic changes in the esophagus on light microscopy.

The regulation of the COX-2 gene has been the subject of extensive study, using traditional transfection techniques with reporter gene constructs. Regulation of the COX-2 gene in living animals, however, requires sacrifice of the animal and in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemical studies. We have utilized in vivo optical imaging technology with a cooled charged coupled device camera to image the expression of the firefly luciferase gene in tumor xenografts that are stably transfected with a chimeric gene containing the first kilobase of the murine COX-2 promoter. Induction of luciferase gene expression following systemic lipopolysaccharide/endotoxin administration can be robustly demonstrated; both a dose-response relationship and a time course for luciferase expression from the COX-2 promoter can be noninvasively analyzed in the tumor xenografts. These data suggest expression from the COX-2 promoter will be easily analyzed in transgenic mice, in knock-in mice, and in somatic cell and gene transfer experiments."}

The impairments could not be captured according to the sonority hierarchy or in terms of a feature level analysis. Caramazza et al. claim that this dissociation demonstrates separate representation of the categories of vowels and consonants in speech processing. We present two connectionist models of the management of phonological representations. The models spontaneously develop separable processing of vowels and consonants. The models have two hidden layers and are given as input vowels and consonants represented in terms of their phonological distinctive features. The first model is presented with feature bundles one at a time and the hidden layers have to combine their output to reproduce a unified copy of the feature bundle. In the second model a \"fine-coded\" layer receives information about feature bundles in isolation, and a \"coarse-coded\" layer receives information about each feature bundle in the context of the prior and subsequent feature bundle. Coarse-coding facilitated processing of vowels and fine-coding processing of consonants. These models show that separable processing of vowels and consonants is an emergent effect of modular processors operating on feature-based representations. We argue that it is not necessary to postulate an independent level of representation for the consonant/vowel distinction, separate from phonological distinctive features."}

Involvement of the medial compartment is the most common and can be successfully treated by unicompartmetal arthroplasty. The first step is to obtain an accurate diagnosis of the process of the disease, and, particularly, to evaluate the integrity of the ACL. Assessment requires clinical, radiographic and perhaps arthroscopic evaluation, but the final decision will depend upon judgement taken at the time of the arthrotomy. This improves with experience and it is essential that the surgeon has sufficient basic understanding and regular practice. The decision on the design of the prosthesis is critical. This should be based on ten-year survivorship studies with a success rate of at least 85% to 90%. The technically more demanding prostheses can give excellent long-term results in some centres. The less complex prostheses can produce good long-term results in more general use. Most studies consistently report lower complication rates, more rapid recovery and long-term results of better quality than TKR. Set against this must be the recognition that failure because of progression of the disease can occur in addition to that due to mechanical causes. There is no convincing evidence that the well-tried and tested prostheses have a significantly greater overall rate of failure than TKR. Reports of revision show that this is not technically demanding and is considerably simpler than for failed TKR with results which are probably little different from those of a primary arthroplasty. The resurgent interest in compartmental arthroplasty is based on encouraging reports from those few centres which have pioneered the treatment. Successful results require a detailed knowledge of the pathology, indications, technique and management of the procedure.

The evidence indicated that potassium interfered with heat activation, and as a result most of the spores failed to germinate. Upon aging of the spores, the potassium effect diminished. It was hypothesized that the system(s) blocked by potassium ions had slowly become active."}

Dimercaptosuccinil acid (DMSA) scan was used based on the relation between vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), infection of the urinary tract (UTI) and parenchymal kidney damage. The number of observed children was 79, 58 (73.41%) girls and 21 (26.58%) boys: following the first UTIs, recidiv infect and with positive VUR contrast voiding cistourethrography (VCUG) and ultrasound tests were compelted following the treatment of infect within 6 weeks and DMSA within 4 months. The classification of VUR was done of I to V degrees. The damage to the renal parenchyma after DMSA was defined as inhomogen distribution, reduced bonding with radio-farmake as well as portion of the kidney in the overall renal function smaller than 45%. Among 45.56% (36/79) patients VUR was registered. Reflux over III/V was registered among 27.84 (22/79) among whom 24.05% (19/79) were younger than 5 years of age. DMSA scan showed reduced kidney function bellow 45%, in one direction 33.33% (12/36) and 25.00% (9/36) in both directions. The correlation between clinically proved acute pielonephrities and damage to the parenchyma was not proven. It was proven in 30.37% (24/79) reoccurring urinal infection. DMSA is a sensitive method that should not be routinely used on every child with urinary infection. It should be left to assess the renal damage in cases of high degree reflux and reoccurring urinary infection."}

Since this type of apoptosis has been referred to as anoikis, we designated these cells as anoikis-positive. However, a minor proportion of Caco-2 cells, designated as anoikis-negative, survived in suspension. Extended incubation of the cells in suspension resulted in the reduction of the number of viable cells. In comparison to the original Caco-2 cell population, the anoikis-negative cells demonstrated markedly decreased levels of expression of integrin alphavbeta3 on the cell surface and of transcription of the alphav subunit gene. Activation of the signaling function of alphavbeta3 in the original Caco-2 cells led to substantial stimulation of anoikis, while the inhibition of expression of this receptor resulted in better resistance of the cells to anoikis. The data provide the first evidence that alphavbeta3 integrin can generate apoptosis-stimulating signals."}

The study population included 13 patients, ranging between 6 and 69 years. The evolution of the clinical features has been assessed by retrospective analysis of the clinical records of the patients. The age-related evolution of the cortical hyperostosis and defective modeling at the tubular bones was evaluated by morphometric analysis of hand films in 9 patients, compared with 9 control individuals. Progression of sclerosis of the craniofacial bones was evaluated by analysis of the skull radiographs of eleven van Buchem patients, taken at different age. Radioclinical features, including sclerosis of the cranial and tubular bones and cranial nerve deficit, become more prominent in older patients. Defective modeling of tubular bones, cortical thickness and medullary width progress with age. Radioclinical abnormalities of van Buchem patients become more prominent in older patients, which suggests that the van Buchem gene is very actively involved in bone metabolism throughout life. Morphometric analysis of the plain films supports the hypothesis that the physiological function of the van Buchem gene is to inhibit bone formation and possibly to regulate bone remodeling."}
{"pmid": "12799172", "title": "Testosterone is correlated with courtship but not aggression in the tropical buff-banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis.", "abstract": "Past studies into the roles of testosterone in birds have focused on species that occur in temperate regions. In such species, plasma testosterone levels are high during the establishment of territories in the spring and are associated with increased aggression. In contrast to most temperate species, tropical birds frequently defend territories year-round, during which time territoriality often occurs in a nonsexual context. The few studies that have been carried out on tropical birds show lower levels of circulating testosterone than occur in their temperate counterparts. In some year-round territorial tropical species, testosterone and aggression are dissociated, while in other species testosterone still plays a role in regulating aggression. This study examined the relationship between aggression and plasma testosterone levels in a year-round territorial, subtropical population of the buff-banded rail with characteristics typical of tropical species. Peak testosterone levels were substantially lower than those found in temperate species. Males displayed a seasonal peak in plasma testosterone level when their partners were most likely to be fertile. At other times, testosterone levels were mostly undetectable, despite year-round territoriality. We found that T levels increased with courtship behavior but showed no relationship with aggression, supporting the hypothesis that dissociation between testosterone and territoriality may be widespread among tropical avian taxa."}

It is becoming increasingly clear that an infection may be an important initiating component within the atherogenic process. However, in order for the infection to contribute to atherosclerosis, it must first be capable of disseminating to the vessel wall. Chlamydia pneumoniae is an example of an infectious atherogenic stimulus. The present treatise reviews our knowledge concerning dissemination of infectious agents like C. pneumoniae. Three factors can be identified that modulate the severity of the infection in the vascular wall. First, although all vascular cell types appear to be infected with agents like C. pneumoniae, there are differences in the sensitivity to infection amongst these cell types. Second, the lipid environment is important in defining the effects of C. pneumoniae on atherosclerotic disease. Third, the inflammatory/atherosclerotic interaction is influenced by the specific infectious stimuli employed. The in situ atherogenic effects of C. pneumoniae may be specific to this organism and may not occur with related infectious agents like C. trachomatis. Despite the identification of these three factors, controversy exists surrounding specific characteristics of these effects. This may be the result of a plethora of differing experimental conditions (different labs, different lipids, different cell types or lines, and different C. pneumoniae characteristics (infection, dosage, duration, etc.)). Further study of these important phenomena is clearly warranted in view of the potential importance of infection to the atherosclerotic disease."}

Cardiac hypertrophy was produced by placing a constricting clip around the suprarenal abdominal aorta of rats, and ET-1 receptor was assayed with radioactive analysis method. It was found that plasma and ventricular ET-1 levels increased significantly on week 2 and week 4 of pressure overload. ET-1 binding studies showed that during myocardial hypertrophy, the maximum binding capacity (B(max)) was increased by 41% (P < 0.01) and 65% (P < 0.01) in sarcolemma in H-2 week and H-4 week groups, but was decreased by 24% (P < 0.01) and 21% (P < 0.01) in light vesicles. The sum of B(max) of sarcolemmal and light vesicle fractions was increased by 33% (P < 0.01) and 57% (P < 0.01) in group H-2 week and H-4 week, respectively. ET-1 receptors in rat heart were externalized from light vesicles to sarcolemma, which may contribute to the development of myocardial hypertrophy."}

The concentration of plasma motilin was measured; the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting and the first flatus time were observed; and the in-hospital day was recorded. 1. The concentration of plasma motilin increased significantly during the first 1 h postoperatively (P < 0.05), but it had no significant difference in the 48 h after operation (P > 0.05) in comparison with the preoperative data in the three groups. The concentration of plasma motilin in Group C was much higher than that in the other two groups during the first 1 h postoperatively (P < 0.05). 2. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was much higher in Group C than that in the other two groups during the first 6 h postoperatively (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the 6 h after operation in the three groups (P > 0.05). 3. The first flatus time and in-hospital day postoperatively had no statistical difference in the three groups (P > 0.05). Different anesthesias do not influence the recovery of intestinal motion and in-hospital day postoperatively; the combined epidural-general anesthesia and propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia may be ideal anesthesias because of the lower incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting."}

TAP is a monomeric protein having a molecular weight (MW) of 49 kDa and a carbohydrate content accounting for 18% of the MW. The yield of pure TAP was relatively high ( approximately 2 mg/kg of fresh roots), with a specific activity of 1810 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) units/mg at pH 6. The activity increased 4-fold at the optimum pH (4.0) to 7250 ABTS units/mg, higher than that of most peroxidases. TAP was heat stable; heat treatment of 25 min at 60 degrees C resulted in 90% initial activity retention, whereas an activity of 20% was retained after 25 min of heating at 80 degrees C. TAP regained 85% of its original activity within 90 min of incubation at 25 degrees C, following heat treatment at 70 degrees C for 25 min. Thermal inactivation caused noticeable changes in the heme environment as evaluated by circular dichroism and visible spectrophotometry. TAP was rapidly denatured by heating in the presence of 1.0 mM ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, but the Soret band and activity were fully recovered by adding an excess of Ca(2+). This is further evidence that Ca(2+) plays an important role in the stability of TAP. The high specific activity of TAP, together with its relatively high thermal stability, has high potential for applications in which a thermally stable enzyme is required."}

It has been argued that this not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) syndrome is partly a result of the attitudes held by the public towards people with mental health problems. The present paper reports some findings from a study of community attitudes towards individuals with mental health problems in a Scottish community, and discusses their implications for the development of public consultation guidelines with respect to the establishment of community mental health facilities. Discourse analysis was used to explore people's views about individuals with mental health problems. The study examined the ways in which their views were expressed in letters to the local press, and in subsequent discussions and interviews, when arguing for or against a supported accommodation project in their neighbourhood. Participants formulated their arguments around a number of issues which they claimed were of public concern. One of these related to the way in which the project was set up. In particular, participants argued that it had been established without any prior consultation with local people and in circumstances of secrecy. The findings demonstrate that, while consultation is relatively unproblematically defined in terms of its function, the specific nature of consultation is more problematic. The implications of these findings for mental health policy and practice are considered in the light of current official guidelines on public consultation relating to the establishment of community mental health facilities. It is argued that existing guidelines fail to take account of the concerns of local people, and therefore, that any intervention based on such guidelines is likely to be ineffective. It is suggested that the findings of this study will be of interest to policy makers and practitioners seeking to devise future public consultation strategies."}

However, the electrophysiological substrate for AF in humans with CHF remains unknown. We evaluated the electrophysiological and electroanatomic characteristics of the atria in patients with CHF. Twenty-one patients (aged 53.7+/-13.6 years) with symptomatic CHF (left ventricular ejection fraction 25.5+/-6.0%) and 21 age-matched controls were studied. The following were evaluated: effective refractory periods (ERPs) from the high and low lateral right atrium (LRA), high septal right atrium, and distal coronary sinus (CS); conduction time along the CS and LRA; corrected sinus node recovery times; P-wave duration; and conduction at the crista terminalis. In a subset, electroanatomic mapping was performed to determine atrial activation, regional conduction velocity, double potentials, fractionated electrograms, regional voltage, and areas of electrical silence. Patients with CHF demonstrated an increase in atrial ERP with no change in the heterogeneity of refractoriness, an increase of atrial conduction time along the LRA and the CS, prolongation of the P-wave duration and corrected sinus node recovery times, and greater number and duration of double potentials along the crista terminalis. Electroanatomic mapping demonstrated regional conduction slowing with a greater number of electrograms with fractionation or double potentials, associated with areas of low voltage and electrical silence (scar). Patients with CHF demonstrated an increased propensity for AF with single extrastimuli, and induced AF was more often sustained. Atrial remodeling due to CHF is characterized by structural changes, abnormalities of conduction, sinus node dysfunction, and increased refractoriness. These abnormalities may be responsible in part for the increased propensity for AF in CHF."}

We have utilized mice with a targeted deletion of Smad3, one of two homologous proteins involved in signaling from TGF-beta/activin, to investigate the function of this particular pathway in transducing such effects of TGF-beta. The dramatic results of the absence of Smad3 on parameters of healing of cutaneous wounds, such as reepithelialization and influx of inflammatory cells, as well as on fibrosis as modeled by radiation fibrosis of skin in mice, suggest that signaling flux through Smad3 is critical for chemotactic activity of TGF-beta, inhibitory effects of TGF-beta on keratinocyte proliferation and migration, and chemoattraction and elaboration of extracellular matrix by fibroblasts in fibrotic diseases. We recently identified a novel molecule, TLP for TRAP-1-like protein, which selectively interferes with Smad3 signaling, and are currently investigating whether levels of this protein might be altered in disease to change the relative flow of information from Smad2 and Smad3."}

The biopsied six muscles with FCMD, six histochemically normal muscles and eight disease control muscles were analyzed by means of immunoblots, immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunoblots showed that the band of FCMD muscle extracts stained with anti-AQP4 antibody was faint in comparison with that of normal muscle extracts. The immunohistochemistry revealed that most of the FCMD myofibers showed negative immunostaining with anti-AQP4 antibody, although the partially positive immunostaining of sporadic FCMD myofibers was noted. The immunoreactivity was positive with anti-dystrophin and anti-beta-spectrin antibodies in almost all FCMD myofibers. The quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the AQP4 mRNA level of the FCMD muscles was markedly reduced. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the expression of AQP4 in FCMD myofibers is reduced and the reduced content of AQP4 mRNA in FCMD muscles may be related to the decreased expression of AQP4 at the muscle plasma membrane of FCMD myofibers."}

Since observations on the same worker are typically more similar than observations from different workers, statistical analysis must take into account the intraworker association due to workers' repeated measures. Additionally, when workers are employed in groups or clusters, observations from workers in the same workplace are typically more similar than observations from workers in different workplaces. For such cluster-correlated longitudinal data, alternating logistic regressions may be used to model the pattern of occupational illness clustering. Data on 182 Latino farm workers from a 1999 North Carolina study on green tobacco sickness provided an estimated pairwise odds ratio for within-worker clustering of 3.15 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.84, 5.41) and an estimated pairwise odds ratio for within-camp clustering of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.22, 2.97).

AI/AN perinatal outcomes and maternal characteristics were compared to those of African American and white women. Similar analyses compared urban and rural AI/AN populations. AI/AN women were more likely than white women to receive inadequate prenatal care (10.4%), to have higher rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension (9.1%) and to have significantly lower rates of primary cesarean delivery (16.9% vs. 22.3%). The rate of macrosomia among births to AI/AN women (24.2%) was notably higher as compared to that in the white population (17.9%). Rates of musculoskeletal and chromosomal anomalies were also higher among AI/AN women, 9 and 4, respectively, per 1,000 live births, as compared to 6 and 2 per 1,000 for the white population.

While studied in detail in the Chelicerata and Crustacea, hemocyanins had long been considered unnecessary in the Myriapoda. Here we report the complete molecular structure of the hemocyanin from the common house centipede Scutigera coleoptrata (Myriapoda: Chilopoda), as deduced from 2D-gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, protein and cDNA sequencing, and homology modeling. This is the first myriapod hemocyanin to be fully sequenced, and allows the investigation of hemocyanin structure-function relationship and evolution. S. coleoptrata hemocyanin is a 6 x 6-mer composed of four distinct subunit types that occur in an approximate 2 : 2 : 1 : 1 ratio and are 49.5-55.5% identical. The cDNA of a fifth, highly diverged, putative hemocyanin was identified that is not included in the native 6 x 6-mer hemocyanin. Phylogenetic analyses show that myriapod hemocyanins are monophyletic, but at least three distinct subunit types evolved before the separation of the Chilopoda and Diplopoda more than 420 million years ago. In contrast to the situation in the Crustacea and Chelicerata, the substitution rates among the myriapod hemocyanin subunits are highly variable. Phylogenetic analyses do not support a common clade of Myriapoda and Hexapoda, whereas there is evidence in favor of monophyletic Mandibulata."}

It was found that PF4 slightly increased the total adherence of resting human neutrophils. There was no change on integrin CD11b level and respiratory burst level of resting human neutrophils after interaction with PF4. However, PF4 significantly down-regulated the total adherence, integrin CD11b level and respiratory burst level of human neutrophils stimulated by FMLP/or PMA.

Among 1,000 inoculated PLBs, 108 putatively transformed PLBs were proliferated on 5 mg/l hygromycin selection medium. A total of 28 independent transgenic orchid plants were obtained, from which six transgenic lines that were positive for beta-glucuronidase were randomly selected and confirmed by Southern, northern and western blot analyses. These results indicated that the foreign DNA was successfully integrated into the orchid genome and expressed transcriptionally and translationally in these orchid plants.

Conversion rates, hospital length of stay, and operating time during the 3 years (n = 100) were compared with a previous year (baseline year) where the faculty performed most of a procedure (n = 20). Each resident performed an average of 17 cases, being the primary surgeon after the sixth case. There were no differences in operative time for both right and left colectomies compared with the baseline year. Postoperative length of stay was less than 5 days by year 3, with a 14% conversion rate to open surgery.

The 1st model is derived from a feature-sampling account of the time course of categorization, whereas the 2nd model is a generalization of a random-walk model of categorization. In the experiments, a new technique was used, which yielded reliable individual-stimulus data through repeated presentation of structurally equivalent items. The results from the experiments showed reliable differences in accuracy and response times between stimuli. The random-walk model provided the better account of the results from the 3 experiments. The implications of the results for process models of recognition are discussed."}

WAK1-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed an Al-induced WAK1 gene expression in roots. Short- and long-term analysis of gene expression in root fractions showed a typical \"on\" and \"off\" pattern with a first peak at 3 h of Al exposure followed by a sharp decline at 6 h and a complete disappearance after 9 h of Al exposure, suggesting the WAK1 is a further representative of Al-induced early genes. In shoots, upon root Al exposure, an increased but stable WAK1 expression was observed. Using confocal microscopy, we visualized Al-induced closure of leaf stomata, consistent with previous suggestions that the Al stress primarily experienced in roots associated with the transfer of root-shoot signals. Elevated levels of WAK protein in root cells were observed through western blots after 6 h of Al exposure, indicating a lag time between the Al-induced WAK transcription and translation. WAK proteins are localized abundantly to peripheries of cortex cells within the elongation zone of the root apex. In these root cells, disintegration of cortical microtubules was observed after Al treatment but not after the Al analog lanthanum treatments. Tip-growing control root hairs, stem stomata, and leaf stomatal pores are characterized with high amounts of WAKs, suggesting WAKs are accumulating at plasma membrane domains, which suffer from mechanical stress and lack dense arrays of supporting cortical microtubules. Further, transgenic plants overexpressing WAK1 showed an enhanced Al tolerance in terms of root growth when compared with the wild-type plants, making the WAK1 one of the important candidates for plant defense against Al toxicity."}

Juvenile or giant fibroadenoma is a rare pathology usually presenting in adolescence, characterized by massive and rapid enlargement of an encapsulated mass. Nowadays there are some preoperative difficulties distinguishing it from cystosarcoma phyllodes which has a benign and malignant form. It is important to differentiate the two pathologies before operation as they have a different therapeutic approach and different follow up. The etiology is believed to be an end-organ hypersensitivity to normal levels of gonadal hormones and the age of presentation is between 10 to 18 years old. Treatment is usually surgical and ranges from simple excision to subcutaneous mastectomy with reconstruction."}

The LD perforator flap is a typical example of thin perforator flap and it can be used widely as a resurfacing tool or reconstructive modality with various composition. Through clinical experience it was validated that a single reliable perforator is sufficient for perfusion of the entire flap. Finally, the perforator concept gives the surgeon the freedom to select, tailor, or compose the flap independently from the limited indications of the conventional flaps, according to the donor or pedicle problems. With increasing use of the perforator flap, the conventional flap can be expanded to its ultimate potential with more reliability."}

To determine whether there is a block in centrosome reduplication, we used a cell fusion assay to compare the duplication potential of unduplicated G1 centrosomes and recently duplicated G2 centrosomes. By fusing cells in different cell cycle stages, we found that G2 centrosomes were unable to reduplicate in a cellular environment that supports centrosome duplication. Furthermore, G2 cytoplasm did not inhibit centrosome duplication in fused cells, indicating that the block to reduplication is intrinsic to the centrosomes rather than the cytoplasm. To test the underlying mechanism, we created mononucleate G1 cells with two centrosomes by fusing cells with enucleated cytoplasts. Both centrosomes duplicated, indicating that the block is not controlled by centrosome:nucleus ratio. We also found that human primary cells have tight control over centrosome number during prolonged S-phase arrest and that this control is partially abrogated in transformed cells. This suggests a link between the control of centrosome duplication and maintenance of genomic stability."}

Morphologically, these strains resembled thermophilic Desulfotomaculum species. The strains grew with alcohols, including methanol, with glucose and fructose as electron donors, and with sulfate, sulfite or thiosulfate as electron acceptors. For all four strains, the optimum temperature and pH for growth were 60 degrees C and pH 7.3, respectively; no added NaCl was required. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed high levels of similarity of the novel strains (>92 %) with Desulfotomaculum kuznetsovii and Desulfotomaculum luciae. However, DNA-DNA hybridization studies with D. kuznetsovii revealed that the four strains belonged to one novel species. A representative of this group of isolates, strain V21(T), is proposed as the type strain of a novel species of the spore-forming, sulfate-reducing genus Desulfotomaculum, namely Desulfotomaculum solfataricum (type strain V21(T)=DSM 14956(T)=CIP 107984(T))."}

DeltaPML-RARalpha is not formed in ATRA differentiation resistant NB4 subclones. As(2)O(3) inhibits deltaPML-RARalpha formation and differentiation-induction when given in combination with ATRA. Treatment with hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) combined with ATRA enhances ATRA-induced differentiation in ATRA-insensitive NB4-CI and arsenic-resistant NB4/As cells, and is associated with stabilization of PML-RARalpha protein and increased deltaPML-RARalpha formation. Unlike forced expression of PML-RARalpha, forced deltaPML-RARalpha expression based on an estimated deletion of the N-terminal PML portion does not repress RARE-tk-luc reporter activity mediated by endogenous retinoic acid receptors. The cleavage of PML-RARalpha is blocked by RARalpha antagonist Ro-41-5253 and cycloheximide and therefore requires a RARalpha transactivation-dependent pathway. Proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK do not block ATRA-induced PML-RARalpha cleavage and differentiation. These data suggest that (a) ATRA treatment induces PML-RARalpha cleavage by induction of unknown enzymes independent of proteasome- and caspase-mediated pathways; (b) deltaPML-RARalpha might function differently from both PML-RARalpha and RARalpha; (c) failure to cleave PML-RARalpha and form deltaPML-RARalpha after ATRA treatment may contribute to ATRA resistance in APL cells."}

The experimental group consisted of 11 subjects who had been trained with musical meditation for six months and the control group consisted of 12 subjects (matched for age, sex and grade) who had not received musical meditation. MMN amplitudes in the trained children were larger than those in the control group. In addition, the MMN amplitudes were identical in attend and ignore conditions for both groups. This evidence suggests that auditory brain function has been affected by musical meditation training. It thus suggests that the MMN is capable of assessing changes to the brain function in normal subjects. There were no significant differences in the P300 latencies and amplitudes between the two groups. This result suggests that MMN and P300 may reflect different aspects of the brain function."}

Twenty-four rats were ovariectomized and treated with vehicle (controls), estradiol or selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen and ICI182780, in order to study the effects on the estrogen receptor levels and distribution in the inner ear. The cochleas were stained immunohistochemically using antibodies against estrogen receptor alpha and beta. No major difference in estrogen receptor content in the cochleas was observed among groups. There was however a potential down regulation of estrogen receptor alpha in the marginal cells of stria vascularis in the rats that were substituted with ICI182780 (pure antiestrogen) as compared to those given estradiol or tamoxifen. When investigating the tissues with light microscopy no change in inner ear anatomy could be observed."}

Of these, 16 (10%) became seizure free. 24 (15%) had at least a 25% increase in seizure frequency. The overall effect was not significantly different for patients with and without learning disability. Levetiracetam also had promising effects in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Side effects were reported by 88 (44%) of all patients. Only 10 (5%) discontinued levetiracetam because of side effects. Behavioural effects were more frequent in patients with learning disability. Levetiracetam was well tolerated and effective as add-on treatment in partial and generalised seizures. Some patients experienced an increase in seizure.

Recently, beta-catenin-accumulated crypts (BCAC) were identified in colonic mucosa at the early stages of colon carcinogenesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that they are independent small dysplastic lesions of ACF. Here we discuss the importance of BCAC as pre-cancerous lesions in colon carcinogenesis."}

Further, there are indications that excess vitamin A as retinol might be detrimental to bone. We determined whether dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D were important for maintaining cortical and trabecular bone mineral density (BMD). We also determined whether nutrient supplements increased retinol intake to a level that would reduce BMD. This was a cross-sectional study of 58 women, age 45-75 years. Dietary intakes and lifestyle factors were assessed by retrospective questionnaires. BMD at the whole body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur (including neck, trochanter, and Wards) was measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone densitometry. There were significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations between total calcium intake and BMD at all sites except spine. At the trochanter, the correlation between total vitamin D and BMD was significant while that between total retinol and BMD showed a trend (p < 0.10). In a stepwise multiple regression, a significant proportion of variance of BMD was accounted for by years since menopause (8.0 to 36.2 %) and body weight (14.5 to 27.1%) at most bone sites. Adding total calcium intake (food + supplements) into the model further accounted for a significant proportion of variance of BMD at cortical bone sites such as hip, femoral neck, Wards, and total body ( 5.2 - 8.4 %). There was no dietary calcium effect on BMD at the spine. The positive effect of total calcium intake on cortical BMD of postmenopausal women not taking estrogen suggests that supplemental calcium use is critical for maintaining bone mass. Increased retinol intake from nutrient supplements had no adverse effect on BMD."}

The syllable recognition score (n=15) was above 80% except in three. The dichotic digit test (n=11) showed bilateral suppression except in two who showed unilateral suppression. The auditory brainstem responses and the acoustic stapedius reflex were absent with distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) present in all. The neurological and radiological studies were normal. The audiological profile is consistent with the presence of DPOAE and absence of acoustic stapedius reflex and auditory brainstem responses. In patients with adequately preserved syllable recognition in quiet conditions, there was a significantly poor performance on dichotic digit test. As these patients had no neurological deficits and absence of specific etiological factors, we propose to use the term PAN for this entity."}

EAN was induced in Lewis rats and sciatic nerves were resected in 18 EAN and 3 normal rats. The expression of tissue integrin alpha6beta4 was analyzed during the course of EAN induction and in controls by in situ hybridization and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The detection of integrin alpha6 and beta4 subunit by hybridization in situ demonstrated that expression of alpha6 subunit present no significant changes during the course of EAN, while expression of beta4 declined in the early phase, showing less positive signals than those of the control, and restored its expression in the later or recovery phase. The changes of expression of integrin alpha6 and beta4 in EAN were confirmed by semi-quantitative PT-PCR, using GAPDH as the internal standard. The degeneration and injury of Sc caused by inflammation affect the expression of integrin, which shows similar changes in Sc during embryogenesis, indicating alpha6beta4 may be a marker of Sc differentiation and at least an important molecule to mark the course of EAN. The expression of alpha6beta4 correlate with the injury and repair of myelin during EAN."}

Shikimate 5-dehydrogenase (SDH) is responsible for NADP-dependent catalysis of the fourth step in shikimate biosynthesis, which is essential for aromatic amino acid metabolism in bacteria, microbial eukaryotes, and plants. The structure of MjSDH is a compact alpha/beta sandwich with two distinct domains, responsible for binding substrate and the NADP cofactor, respectively. A phylogenetically conserved deep cleft on the protein surface corresponds to the enzyme active site. The structure reveals a topologically new domain fold within the N-terminal segment of the polypeptide chain, which binds substrate and supports dimerization. Insights gained from homology modeling and sequence/structure comparisons suggest that the SDHs represent a unique class of dehydrogenases. The structure provides a framework for further investigation to discover and develop novel inhibitors targeting this essential enzyme."}

The pH-insensitive fluorophore serves as an internal reference and makes calibration unnecessary. The sensor measures pH accurately in optically well-defined media. Particles and fluorophores contained in the bulk medium disturbed the measurements. Despite these disturbances it was possible to clearly sense differences in inoculum type and in inoculum sizes of cultures of Lactococcus lactis and of Streptococcus thermophilus at 30 and 37 degrees C. Besides a pH-related signal there is information about other changes during milk fermentation. The cultivation results were compared with those from the established CINAC-method.

Their offspring and those from unstressed dams (12) were given amitriptyline (4.5 mg/kg per day) in the drinking water between 4 and 10 weeks of age. Behaviour was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) in week 10 in group 1 while still receiving the drug; in group 2, 2 weeks after stopping the drug, and in group 3, as in group 2, but after prior exposure to an open field (OF). When tested while receiving the drug, no clear anxiolytic effect was seen in PS rats, and anxiety was actually increased in control rats, as indicated by the greater amount of time in closed arms of the EPM. Significant anxiolytic effects of amitriptyline (increase in time in open arms of EPM) were seen 2 weeks after stopping the drug in PS females. It could only be demonstrated in PS males after their anxiety in the EPM had been increased as a result of prior exposure to the open field. Chronic early treatment with amitriptyline can prevent the development of hyperanxiety in PS rats in adulthood. This effect is only detectable after cessation of drug treatment. The anxiolytic effect is more readily detected in females."}

Superimposition of the two sets of stimuli without fading, or an abrupt transfer from the first to the second set of stimuli, resulted in the occurrence of errors during transfer. Superimposition, however, did result in some \"incidental learning\". Performance following acquisition of the vertical-horizontal discrimination with errors differed from performance following acquisition without errors. If the vertical-horizontal discrimination was learned with errors, the latency of the response to S+ was permanently shortened and errors occurred during subsequent testing on the red-green discrimination even though the red-green discrimination was originally acquired without errors. If the vertical-horizontal discrimination was learned without errors, the latency of the response to S+ was unaffected and no errors occurred during subsequent testing on the red-green discrimination."}

Both the Sm-core complex and the snRNA trimethylguanosine cap are required for the efficient nuclear import of snRNPs. Here, we show that trimethylguanosine synthase 1 (TGS1), the human homologue of the yeast snRNA cap hypermethylase, interacts directly with the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. Both proteins are similarly distributed, localizing in the cytoplasm and in nuclear Cajal bodies. The interaction between TGS1 and SMN is disrupted by a mutation in SMN that mimics the predominant isoform of the protein that is expressed in patients with the neurodegenerative disease, spinal muscular atrophy. These data indicate that, in addition to its function in cytoplasmic Sm-core assembly, the SMN protein also functions in the recruitment of the snRNA cap hypermethylase."}

A recent candidate is a homologue of squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA1), a serpin. This study confirms that transfection of SCCA1 into mammalian cells (both hepatocyte-derived and of non-hepatocyte origin) results in increased HBV binding. Furthermore, virus bound to transfected cells is protected significantly from degradation by trypsin (75% compared with 30% in untransfected cells). The possibility that HBV enters cells via the hepatic clearance system for serpin-enzyme complexes was investigated by analysis of the reactive site loop of SCCA1. Functional and deletion mutants of SCCA1 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and compared with the wild type construct. In no case was virus binding reduced by functional alterations or deletions within the reactive site loop. A possible role for the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in binding virus was investigated. SCCA1 transfection of Huh7 cells was shown to result in up-regulation of LRP expression, reaching levels observed in total liver. However, the use of receptor-associated protein (RAP), a competitive ligand for LRP, suggests than LRP up-regulation is not responsible for enhanced virus binding to SCCA1-transfected cells."}

Our results indicated that OPN expression was enhanced during the bone formation and that OPN would be one of the positive factors for the bone formation under mechanical stress. Bone formation is known to be stimulated by mechanical stress; however, molecules involved in stress-dependent regulation of bone formation have not yet been fully characterized. Extracellular matrix proteins such as osteopontin (OPN) could play a role in mediation of the mechanical stress signal to osteoblasts. However, the function of OPN in bone formation under mechanical force is not known. Therefore, we examined the expression and the role of OPN in bone formation in vivo under tensile mechanical stress. Sagittal sutures of mice were subjected to expansion mechanical stress by setting orthodontic spring wires, and OPN expression during bone formation within the suture gap was examined. Expansion of the sutures resulted in bone formation at the edges of the parietal bones within the sagittal suture. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed abundant accumulation of OPN protein in the matrix of newly formed bone on the inner edge of the parietal bone within the mechanically expanded sutures. Osteoblasts forming bone within the suture subjected to tensile stress also exhibited high levels of OPN protein expression. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated that OPN mRNA expression was enhanced in wild-type calvariae subjected to expansion force compared with the control calvariae where dead spring wires were set without expansion stress. In addition, type I collagen mRNA was also expressed in the calvariae under the mechanical stimuli. To understand the function of OPN, sagittal sutures in OPN-deficient mice were subjected the expansion stress, and bone formation within the suture to fill the expanded gap was compared with that observed in wild-type mice. OPN deficiency reduced bone formation at the edge of the parietal bone in contact with the expanded suture gap. These observations revealed that OPN plays a pivotal role in bone formation under tensile mechanical stress."}

Aminolevulinic acid is a prodrug that is metabolized intracellularly to form the photosensitizing molecule protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). When PpIX is activated by light, cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and free radicals are generated. This phototoxic effect may cause malignant and non-malignant hyperproliferative tissue to be destroyed, to decrease in size, and to eventually disappear. The application of topical aminolevulinic acid 20% followed by the use of a blue light photodynamic therapy illuminator is indicated in the US for the treatment of non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses of the face or scalp. There are data suggesting that aminolevulinic acid/photodynamic therapy may also be beneficial in acne vulgaris, verrucae, psoriasis, mycosis fungoides, and human papillomavirus. This treatment modality has also proven effective in the management of skin cancer such as, Bowen disease and basal cell carcinoma. Further experience in the use of photodynamic therapy will help define its utility in the management of actinic keratosis and other dermatoses."}

Survey material consisted of 124 human foetus thyroids aged 4-7 months of intrauterine development. The basic examination method was classical anatomical preparation. Three aspects were considered in thyroid isthmus position assessment: holotopy, skeletotopy and syntopy. The gland holotopy analysis was carried out with the usage of isthmus position indices elaborated especially for the studies. The results were statistically analysed. Thyroid isthmus was observed to change its position. Although statistically significant differences in thyroid isthmus position were not proved, some tendencies of the one-position changes were detected, especially of larynx and trachea skeletons. The tendencies were based on a relatively more significant lowering of isthmus in comparison with gland lateral lobes. The basic reason for thyroid isthmus position changes in the development period is a disproportion between foetus gland and cervix growth rates."}

The presented method is also very simple and versatile and can be used to create meta predictions even from sets of models produced by humans. An additional and very important and novel feature of the system is the high correlation between the reported confidence score and the accuracy of the model. The number of correctly predicted residues can be estimated directly from the prediction score. The high reliability of the method enables any biologist to submit a target of interest to the Meta Server and screen with relatively high confidence, whether the target can be predicted by fold recognition methods while being unpredictable using standard approaches like PSI-Blast. This can point to interesting relationships which could have been missed in annotations of proteins or genomes and provide very valuable information for novel scientific discoveries."}

These studies have shown either neuroprotection or neurotoxicity by PPARgamma ligands. Comparison of these studies is complicated by the use of different PPARgamma ligands, mechanisms of neurotoxicity induction, and neuronal cell type. In this study, we compared the effects of the synthetic PPARgamma ligand ciglitazone with an endogenous PPARgamma ligand, 15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15-deoxy PGJ(2)), on inherent neurotoxicity and neuroprotection using a reduction in extracellular KCl in rat cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGN). We also assessed the effects of these ligands on c-Jun protein expression, which is up-regulated on induction of low-KCl-mediated neuronal apoptosis as well as being associated with PPAR in other cell types. We showed that PPARgamma mRNA is expressed in CGN cultures and observed ciglitazone- and 15-deoxy PGJ(2)-mediated inherent neurotoxicity that was concentration and time dependent. c-Jun was only modestly increased in the presence of ciglitazone but was markedly up-regulated by 15-deoxy PGJ(2) after 12 hr. Treatment of CGN cultures with ciglitazone simultaneous with KCl withdrawal resulted in a modest, time-dependent neuroprotection. Such neuroprotection after KCl withdrawal was not observed with 15-deoxy PGJ(2). Despite the absence of neuroprotection, 15-deoxy PGJ(2) markedly inhibited the early up-regulation of c-Jun during KCl withdrawal. These studies suggest that ciglitazone and 15-deoxy PGJ(2) have markedly different effects on inherent and low-KCl-induced toxicity and c-Jun expression in CGN, indicating potential non-PPARgamma mechanisms."}

The NO-induced dopaminergic cell loss causing Parkinson's disease (PD) has been postulated to include the following: an inhibition of cytochrome oxidase, ribonucleotide reductase, mitochondrial complexes I, II, and IV in the respiratory chain, superoxide dismutase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; activation or initiation of DNA strand breakage, poly(ADP-ribose) synthase, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation; release of iron; and increased generation of toxic radicals such as hydroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite. NO is formed by the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline by NO synthase (NOS). At least three NOS isoforms have been identified by molecular cloning and biochemical studies: a neuronal NOS or type 1 NOS (nNOS), an immunologic NOS or type 2 NOS (iNOS), and an endothelial NOS or type 3 NOS (eNOS). The enzymatic activities of eNOS or nNOS are induced by phosphorylation triggered by Ca(2+) entering cells and binding to calmodulin. In contrast, the regulation of iNOS seems to depend on de novo synthesis of the enzyme in response to a variety of cytokines, such as interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide. The evidence that NO is associated with neurotoxic processes underlying PD comes from studies using experimental models of this disease NOS inhibitors can prevent 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Furthermore, NO fosters dopamine depletion, and the said neurotoxicity is averted by nNOS inhibitors such as 7-nitroindazole working on tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. Moreover, mutant mice lacking the nNOS gene are more resistant to MPTP neurotoxicity when compared with wild-type littermates. Selegiline, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B, is used in PD as a dopaminergic function-enhancing substance. Selegiline and its metabolite, desmethylselegiline, reduce apoptosis by altering the expression of a number of genes, for instance, superoxide dismutase, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, NOS, c-Jun, and nicotinamide adenine nucleotide dehydrogenase. The selegiline-induced antiapoptotic activity is associated with prevention of a progressive reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential in preapoptotic neurons. As apoptosis is critical to the progression of neurodegenerative disease, including PD, selegiline or selegiline-like compounds to be discovered in the future may be efficacious in treating PD."}

As such, Eph kinases represent potential targets for drug design, which requires the knowledge of structural features responsible for their specific interactions. To overcome the existing gap between available sequence and structure information we have built 3D models of eight ephrins and 13 Eph kinase ligand-binding domains using homology modeling techniques. The interaction energies for several molecular probes with binding sites of these models were calculated using GRID and subjected to chemometrical classification based on consensus principal component analysis (CPCA). Despite inherent limitations of the homology models, CPCA was able to successfully distinguish between ephrins and Eph kinases, between Eph kinase subfamilies, and between ephrin subfamilies. As a result we have identified several amino acids that may account for selectivity in ephrin-Eph kinase interactions. In general, although the difference in charge between ephrin and Eph kinase binding domains creates an attractive long-range electrostatic force, the hydrophobic and steric interactions are highly important for the short-range interactions between two proteins. The chemometrical analysis also provides the pharmacophore model, which could be used for virtual screening and de novo ligand design."}

Nitric oxide (NO) is an important modulator of mitochondrial function and is known to inhibit mitochondrial respiration. However, the impact of chronic alcohol consumption on NO-dependent control of liver mitochondrial function is unknown. This study examines the effect of alcohol exposure on liver mitochondria in a rat model and explores the interaction of NO and mitochondrial respiration in this context. Mitochondria were isolated from the liver of both control and ethanol-fed rats after 5 to 6 weeks of alcohol consumption. Mitochondria isolated from ethanol-treated rats showed a significant decrease in state 3 respiration and respiratory control ratio that was accompanied by an increased sensitivity to NO-dependent inhibition of respiration. In conclusion, we show that chronic alcohol consumption leads to increased sensitivity to the inhibition of respiration by NO. We propose that this results in a greater vulnerability to hypoxia and the development of alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity."}

This appears to be related to a higher expression and/or activity of stretch-activated channels, whereas leak channel activities are similar. During hindlimb suspension (HU), we found highly correlated decreases in SPCa and resting calcium of soleus muscle toward values of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. This was significant as soon as 3 days of suspension, contrary to soleus muscle caffeine sensitivity and responsiveness that were not modified after this HU period. After 14 days of HU, SP-Ca, resting calcium, and caffeine response of soleus muscle became similar to that normally observed in EDL muscle. These results demonstrate that the correlated decreases in SP-Ca and resting calcium precede most functional changes due to HU. Given the known shortening of HU soleus muscle, we proposed that this could induce a decrease of SP-Ca and a consequent reduction of resting calcium. According to the crucial role of resting cytosolic free calcium in the maintenance and the adaptation of muscle phenotype, our results suggest that slow-to-fast transition of HU soleus muscle is calcium dependent."}

Consequently, we began using nitinol mesh stents (Ultraflex) for fibrous stenoses and silicone-covered prostheses (Rush) for proliferative tracheal tumors. The extractable nitinol stent, made from alloy with thermal memory, was palliatively used in 15 patients with fibrous tracheal stenosis; the mean follow-up currently covers 21 months (range: 1-60 months). The silicone-covered prosthesis was used for two patients with inoperable tracheal tumor; follow-up covers 4 months and 2 months, respectively. The prostheses were positioned under visual guidance via the endoscopic approach. The median forced inspiratory volume in 1 s (FIV1) improved from 2.1 l/s (IQR: 0.7-2.4) to 3.2 l/s (IQR: 0.9-3.4) (P=0.018, Wilcoxon signed rank test).

In this study, we examined the effect of Ag(+), a known cytotoxic sulfhydryl-reactive heavy metal, on isolated rat liver mitochondria. The following results were obtained: (1) Upon addition, Ag(+) instantly induced mitochondrial swelling and acceleration of respiration. (2) Cyclosporine A, a specific inhibitor of classical PT, was ineffective against the effect of Ag(+), indicating that silver ions induced non-classic PT. (3) Sulfhydryl reagents such as reduced glutathione completely inhibited the effects of Ag(+) on the mitochondria. (4) Experimental results using polyethylene glycol indicated that Ag(+) induced opening of a pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane, which could be PTP of another open state or a distinct pore. (5) Electron microscopic analysis of mitochondria treated with Ag(+) showed a novel mitochondrial configuration that was apparently different from that of normal mitochondria or Ca(2+)-treated mitochondria. (6) Ag(+) also induced the release of apoptogenic cytochrome c in a CsA-insensitive but GSH-sensitive manner.

This paper describes the coping strategies of 137 senior clients who were discharged from home support services and from the Continuing Care Program in the Simon Fraser Health Region located in British Columbia, Canada. Personal interviews were conducted by experienced case managers to gain an understanding of how seniors were coping 19 to 21 months after their discharge. Of the 137 clients, 34.3% are characterized as being \"home alone and suffering in silence,\" 29.2% reported receiving assistance from informal sources or reported paying out-of-pocket for private care, and 28.4% reported that they can do the work better themselves. The remaining 8.0% of participants reported mixed feelings about the impact of their discharge from home support service. The effectiveness of discharge targeted to a senior population is discussed and it is suggested that functional status together with age are important criteria when rationing home care services."}

To address this issue, we have analyzed how Hoxa2 specifies segmental identity in the second branchial arch. Using a subtraction approach, we found that Ptx1 was upregulated in the second arch mesenchyme of Hoxa2 mutants. This upregulation has functional significance because, in Hoxa2(-/-);Ptx1(-/-) embryos, the Hoxa2(-/-) phenotype is partially reversed. Hoxa2 interferes with the Ptx1 activating process, which is dependent on Fgf signals from the epithelium. Consistently, Lhx6, another target of Fgf8 signaling, is also upregulated in the Hoxa2(-/-) second arch mesenchyme. Our findings have important implications for the understanding of developmental processes in the branchial area and suggest a novel mechanism for mesenchymal patterning by Hox genes that acts to define the competence of mesenchymal cells to respond to skeletogenic signals."}

To gain insights into the action mechanism of 1,3-beta-D-glucan pattern recognition protein in the insect prophenoloxidase (proPO) activation system, we purified a 53-kDa 1,3-beta-D-glucan recognition protein (Tm-GRP) to homogeneity from the hemolymph of the mealworm, Tenebrio molitor, by using a 1,3-beta-d-glucan affinity column. The purified protein specifically bound to 1,3-beta-D-glucan but not to peptidoglycan. Subsequent molecular cloning revealed that Tm-GRP contains a region with close sequence similarity to bacterial glucanases. Strikingly, two catalytically important residues in glucanases are replaced with other nonhomologous amino acids in Tm-GRP. The finding suggests that Tm-GRP has evolved from an ancestral gene of glucanases but retained only the ability to recognize 1,3-beta-D-glucan. A Western blot analysis of the protein level of endogenous Tm-GRP showed that the protein was specifically degraded following the activation of proPO with 1,3-beta-D-glucan and calcium ion. The degradation was significantly retarded by the addition of serine protease inhibitors but not by cysteine or acidic protease inhibitor. These results suggest that 1,3-beta-D-glucan pattern recognition protein is specifically degraded by serine protease(s) during proPO activation, and we propose that this degradation is an important regulatory mechanism of the activation of the proPO system."}

The pH range for growth was 4.8-8.5, with an optimum at pH 6.5-6.8. Growth of strain SC 562T was observed at NaCl concentrations ranging from 1.5 to 6% (w/v). The substrates utilized by strain SC 562T included casein, peptone, albumin, yeast extract, beef extract, alanine plus proline and starch. Glucose, maltose, pyruvate, valine and arginine each slightly stimulated growth in the presence of yeast extract. The products of glucose fermentation were ethanol, acetate, H2 and CO2. Strain SC 562T reduced elemental sulfur to hydrogen sulfide. The G + C content of the DNA of strain SC 562T was 24 mol%. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that the isolated organism belonged to cluster XI of the Clostridium subphylum. On the basis of its physiological properties and phylogenetic analyses, it is proposed that strain SC 562T represents the sole species of a novel genus, Tepidibacter; the name Tepidibacter thalassicus is proposed for strain SC 562T (=DSM 15285T=UNIQEM 215T)."}

(Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D.C.), Stanley Falkow, and L. S. Baron. Recipient ability of Salmonella typhosa in genetic crosses with Escherichia coli. J. Bacteriol. 87:54-60. 1964.-Salmonella typhosa strain 643WS(r) was mated with Escherichia coli Hfr strains W1895 and Hayes, with single marker selection for the E. coli genes lac(+) (lactose utilization) and ara(+) (arabinose utilization). Four classes of Salmonella hybrids were obtained, each class possessing one marker derived from one E. coli parent. In a series of eight genetic crosses, in which each hybrid class was remated with each of the Hfr strains, recipient ability of the hybrids was increased only when their substituted E. coli genetic section matched the lead region of the Hfr chromosome. Data obtained from replica plating indicated that the S. typhosa 643WS(r) population is probably homogeneous with respect to its initial ability to mate with E. coli. Transfer of the F-lac element was found to occur only slightly less efficiently from an E. coli F' donor to S. typhosa than it did to an E. coli F(-) strain. This indicated that E. coli is able to conjugate almost as effectively with S. typhosa as it does intraspecifically. However, failure to detect beta-galactosidase production by merozygotes derived from an E. coli Hfr W1895 x S. typhosa mating indicated that transfer of chromosomal lac(+) may be impaired."}

Seventy-four clinical samples (cerebrospinal fluid, blood, sputum, throat and nasal swabs) and throat swabs of 17 asymptomatic carriers were collected. Primers were used to amplify the hel gene of H. influenzae encoding P4 outer membrane protein directly from the processed samples. The samples were also examined by conventional culture methods and the results were compared with those of PCR. The culture methods showed positive results in 60 (65.9%) of 91 samples in contrast to 62 (68.12%) samples tested positive by PCR. None of the culture-positive samples were PCR-negative while two of the culture-negative samples were PCR-positive. The specificity of the products was confirmed by Southern hybridization and failure of various other organisms to amplify the hel gene product. The sensitivity of the PCR assay was found to be 50 pg of DNA. These findings suggest that the hel gene PCR is a rapid, sensitive and a specific new method for direct identification of H. influenzae. Thus, this PCR test can improve the detection rate of H. influenzae in suspected clinical samples as compared with that of conventional culture methods."}

Microbiol. 2 (2000) 617), it is not known whether vertebrate cell death requires direct amoeba-vertebrate cell contact or simply the presence of amoebae in the area of the vertebrate cells. In addition, Entamoeba spp. vary in their virulence and pathogenicity. The potential effects of these critical parameters also have not been elucidated. We tested the virulent HM-1:IMSS isolate and the non-virulent Rahman isolate of E. histolytica, and the non-virulent E. dispar CYNO16:TPC isolate against two vertebrate cell lines, HeLa and Chinese hamster ovary cells in vitro using ethidium homodimer as a fluorescent indicator of changes in vertebrate cell permeability. Fluorescence appeared in vertebrate cell nuclei within approximately 2-3 min of contact between HM-1 amoebae and vertebrate cells independent of vertebrate cell type. However, vertebrate cells in the immediate vicinity of but not contacted by HM-1 amoebae were not affected. In contrast, although both E. histolytica Rahman and E. dispar CYNO16 amoebae moved freely among and contacted vertebrate cells, the nuclei of the vertebrate cells never fluoresced implying that the cells remained alive and impermeant to the ethidium homodimer. This is the first demonstration that direct contact between virulent amoebae and vertebrate cells is required to kill vertebrate cells and that the process is restricted to virulent Entamoeba isolates. An understanding at the molecular level of the processes involved could help to reduce the pathology associated with this parasite."}

Responses to electrical stimulation.", "abstract": "An analysis of the various parts of the electrical responses to the chemical and electrical stimulation of a single labellar chemosensory hair of the blowfly, Phormia regina, indicates that the recording conditions for the spike potentials approximate the intracellular recordings made in other types of sense cells. The large positive resting potential probably arises from the basement membrane of the hypodermal cells and neurilemma rather than from the neurons at the base of the chemosensory hair. The responses to polarizing currents passed through single chemosensory hairs support this analysis. The behavioral responses to similar polarizing currents are shown to result from the action of the current on the neurons at the bases of the adjacent chemosensory hairs. The reported neural interaction of the two chemosensory neurons associated with the chemosensory hair is probably due to the physical-chemical attributes of the stimulating solution rather than to any real neural interaction. Observations on the latency of the initial nerve impulse in response to chemical stimulation indicate that the chemosensory neurons are normally free from spontaneous spike activity."}

Although optimal protocols for peptide-based vaccines have not yet been elucidated, boosting the immune system could be a better approach than priming the immune system to elicit prompt and potent peptide-specific T-cell responses in cancer patients. With this possibility in mind, the authors undertook a clinical trial in which cancer patients were vaccinated with peptides (maximum 4) after confirmation of pre-existing peptide-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) precursors in the periphery. Fourteen patients (seven with melanoma and seven with other types of cancer) positive for either HLA-A24 or HLA-A2 were enrolled in this study. Fourteen and 16 peptides were used to screen for HLA-A24+ and HLA-A2+ patients, respectively. The vaccination was well tolerated, and the only adverse effects were local pain and fever. Kinetic analysis revealed that peptide-reactive CTLs increased after peptide vaccination in 7 of 14 patients. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactive to the administered peptides was detected in 2 patients before vaccination, although it became detectable in 8 of the other 12 patients after the peptide vaccination. Stable disease for more than 6 months was observed in five patients (one with melanoma and four with other types of cancer); all of these patients showed increased levels of peptide-specific IgG. These results indicate that peptide vaccination of patients showing evidence of pre-existing peptide-specific CTL precursors can be applied in further clinical trials aimed at the treatment of melanoma and other types of cancer."}

The crystal structure of Aip1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was determined to a 2.3-A resolution and a final crystallographic R-factor of 0.204. The structure reveals that the overall fold is formed by two connected seven-bladed beta-propellers and has important implications for the structure of Aip1 from other organisms and WD repeat-containing proteins in general. These results were unexpected because a maximum of 10 WD repeats had been reported in the literature for this protein using sequence data. The surfaces of the beta-propellers formed by the D-A and B-C loops are positioned adjacent to one another, giving Aip1p a shape that resembles an open \"clamshell.\" The mapping of conserved residues to the structure of Aip1p reveals dense patches of conserved residues on the surface of one beta-propeller and at the interface of the two beta-propellers. These two patches of conserved residues suggest a potential binding site for F-actin on Aip1p and that the orientation of the beta-propellers with respect to one another plays a role in binding an actin-cofilin complex. In addition, the conserved interface between the domains is mediated by a number of interactions that appear to impart rigidity between the two domains of Aip1p and may make a large substrate-induced conformational change difficult."}

This work delivers the first 3D structural data and explains how curcumin interacts with the fatty acid metabolizing enzyme, soybean lipoxygenase. Curcumin binds to lipoxygenase in a non-competitive manner. Trapped in that complex, it undergoes photodegradation in the X-rays, but utilizes enzyme catalytic ability to form the peroxy complex Enz-Fe-O-O-R as 4-hydroperoxy-2-methoxy-phenol, that later transforms into 2-methoxycyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-dione. Our observations about this radiation and time-dependent inhibition add new information to the role that curcumin might play in cancer prevention and treatment."}

The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was developed as an instrument for cross-national monitoring of physical activity and inactivity. Between 1997 and 1998, an International Consensus Group developed four long and four short forms of the IPAQ instruments (administered by telephone interview or self-administration, with two alternate reference periods, either the \"last 7 d\" or a \"usual week\" of recalled physical activity). During 2000, 14 centers from 12 countries collected reliability and/or validity data on at least two of the eight IPAQ instruments. Test-retest repeatability was assessed within the same week. Concurrent (inter-method) validity was assessed at the same administration, and criterion IPAQ validity was assessed against the CSA (now MTI) accelerometer. Spearman's correlation coefficients are reported, based on the total reported physical activity. Overall, the IPAQ questionnaires produced repeatable data (Spearman's rho clustered around 0.8), with comparable data from short and long forms. Criterion validity had a median rho of about 0.30, which was comparable to most other self-report validation studies. The \"usual week\" and \"last 7 d\" reference periods performed similarly, and the reliability of telephone administration was similar to the self-administered mode. The IPAQ instruments have acceptable measurement properties, at least as good as other established self-reports. Considering the diverse samples in this study, IPAQ has reasonable measurement properties for monitoring population levels of physical activity among 18- to 65-yr-old adults in diverse settings. The short IPAQ form \"last 7 d recall\" is recommended for national monitoring and the long form for research requiring more detailed assessment."}

A disorganization of smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix components in the venous wall have been described. The objective of this paper is to offer an explanation for the abnormal distensibility of varicose veins. The content of hydroxyproline was quantified in control and varicose human saphenous veins. The synthesis of collagen types I, III, and V was quantified in cultured venous smooth muscle cells and dermal fibroblasts of control subjects and patients with varicose veins. The proportion of collagen type III in the heterofibrils composed by collagen types I, III, and V was calculated. The level of hydroxyproline was increased in varicose veins, suggesting an increased content of collagen. This augmentation of collagen in diseased tissues appears to be correlated with an increase of collagen type I since the collagen I mRNA was overexpressed in varicose veins, whereas collagen type III mRNA was not altered. The quantification of collagen synthesis in cultured cells shows that proportion of collagen type III was significantly decreased in cultured smooth muscle cells and dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with varicose veins. The results indicate a deficiency in collagen type III in patients with varicose veins. Since collagen type III is involved in tissue elasticity, these results offer an explanation for the abnormal distensibility of varicose veins. Moreover, this defect seems to be generalized in different tissues and argues in favor of a genetic alteration of remodeling in these patients."}

However the optimal LMWH regimen, offering the greatest efficacy with an acceptable risk of bleeding, has not been clearly established with regard to dose and timing of treatment initiation. We performed a meta-analysis of all available randomised trials comparing LMWH to placebo. Relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. By means of subgroup analysis, we evaluated the consistency of the results according to the timing of treatment initiation (preoperative versus postoperative) and dose of LMWH used (low doses, i.e. 4000 anti-Xa IU or below versus high doses). The possibility of a dose-effect relationship of LMWH was also evaluated by meta-regression. Thirteen studies were included (1925 patients). In four studies, LMWH treatment was started postoperatively. Daily LMWH doses ranged from 3000 anti-Xa IU to over 6000 anti-Xa IU. Compared to placebo, LMWH significantly reduced the risk of asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR=0.51, 95% CI=[0.45-0.59], p<0.001) without significantly increasing the risk of major haemorrhage (RR=0.80 [0.36-1.79], p=0.58). We found no convincing evidence that starting prophylaxis preoperatively was associated with a significantly reduced risk of asymptomatic DVT relative to starting postoperatively. Our results showed a strong correlation between the risk of DVT and LMWH dose (meta-regression, test of slope p=0.03). These findings are tentative because the comparisons are across trials, but nevertheless suggest that the different LMWH regimens currently recommended are effective and safe."}

The incidence of grade 2/3 and higher HAI was higher in patients with viral hepatitis C. The incidence of grade 2/3 was associated with vascular invasion of HCC, postoperative liver dysfunction, and cancer recurrence. Higher MI (> or = 5) was significantly associated with vascular invasion, poor histological differentiation, and recurrence rate (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that higher grade was the factor strongly associated with cancer recurrence (odds ratio: 10.621, P = 0.006). Higher MI correlated with overall patient survival (P < 0.05) by univariate analysis. Grading and MI are the useful prognostic markers for predicting tumor recurrence and patient survival."}

This involves the potentiometric measurement of the volume of 0.08 N NaOH required to maintain a constant pH (8.0) during the time of the hydrolysis. It is a sensitive method which presents several advantages; viz., it measures simultaneously protease and esterase activity, it follows the hydrolysis very closely and from the first stages; the titration is continuous and on the same sample. This method determines a constant fraction of the groups titratable by formol titration. The ratio formol: direct titration is represented by a factor \"f\" which is presumed to be distinct for each protein-enzyme system. Kinetic studies, using this method, revealed that the rates of hydrolysis of mixtures casein-gelatin on one hand, casein-BAEE or gelatin-BAEE on the other, are always larger than those of the corresponding isolated substrates. In many cases the resulting rates are equal or nearly equal to the sum of the individual rates, even though the mentioned rates have been determined within the saturation zones for every substrate. The former observations are inconsistent with the theory of the formation of an intermediary enzyme-substrate compound, unless it is assumed that the enzyme has a specific active group for each substrate."}

One of the great challenges of the future is to understand enough about the basic biology of animal regeneration and to use it for the betterment of the mankind. It is well established that the initial stages of urodele limb regeneration depend on the presence of intact nerve fibres connected to their cell bodies. The nerve fibres severed at the limb amputation level, regrow and invade the blastema, providing blastema cells with indispensable factors. These factors are elaborated within the neuron perikarya and transported via their axons to the blastema. Numerous studies have been so far performed and have elucidated the quantitative relationships between nerve fibres and limb regeneration. However, there are no reports dealing with the individual nerve cells at work. The aim of the present investigation was to analyse the quantitative participation and qualitative distinction of nerve cells innervating regenerating parts of the urodele limb and their possible interrelationship with the nerve-dependent and nerve-independent periods of regeneration. The cells under study are housed in the dorsal ganglia (sensory neurons) and in the ventral aspect of the spinal cord grey matter (motor neurons). As a means of visualizing the direct implication of these neurons during various regeneration periods, the enzyme horseradish peroxidase was chosen. A total of 34 animals were used, 21 experimental and 13 controls, in order to study labeled nerve cell fluctuations. The results are summarized as follows: (a) The first nerve cells incorporating HRP within 5 days post amputation are found in the dorsal ganglia. Motor neurons in the grey matter are labeled within 7 days. (b) The number of labeled perikarya increases during the nerve-dependent regeneration period (0-21 dpa). The percentage of implicated sensory neurons exceeds that found in the control series. (c) During the next, nerve-independent period, the number of participating labeled neurons decreases gradually. Such fluctuations in the number of labeled neurons might represent the metabolic status of these cells in their effort to provide the blastema cells with the factors needed at the appropriate time. The current findings support previous observations that the periods of dependence and independence of urodele limb regeneration from the integrated control of brachial nerves reflect changes in the metabolism of individual sensory and motor neurons."}

One matrix component, TNF-alpha-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), is a hyaluronan binding protein induced in cumulus cells of preovulatory follicles by the LH surge and is decreased in cumulus cells of COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor subtype EP2 null mice that exhibit impaired ovulation and cumulus expansion. To determine if TSG-6 was hormonally induced in cumulus cells in vitro and was functional during the formation of the expanded matrix, we established a cumulus cell-oocyte complex (COC) culture system. This system was used to analyze the effects of FSH, PGE2, EP2 receptor, and selected protein kinase inhibitors on TSG-6 production as well as specific antibodies to the TSG-6 link module on TSG-6 function. We document that TSG-6 message and protein are induced by cAMP/protein kinase A/MAPK signaling pathways and that blocking these cascades prevents expansion and the production of TSG-6. FSH but not PGE2 rescued expansion and production of TSG-6 in the EP2 null COCs, indicating that generation of a cAMP signal is essential. Furthermore, disruption of the functional interactions between TSG-6, inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor, and hyaluronan with specific antibodies severely altered matrix formation and cumulus expansion, as recorded by time-lapse imaging. Collectively, these results indicate that TSG-6 mRNA is induced in cumulus cells in culture by cAMP and that the secreted TSG-6 protein is a key structural component of the mouse COC matrix."}

Creams (o/w emulsions) were prepared by phase inversion and physical properties as particle size of the internal phase, apparent viscosity, and sedimentation volume evaluated. Stability was performed at room temperature, 40 degrees C, 50 degrees C, and under stress conditions. High hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) nonionic surfactants as tween 80, tween 20, Myrj 52, Brij 35, and low HLB span 60 were used as emulsifying agents. The percentage of internal phase components (cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), percentage of emulsifying agents, and percentage of aqueous external phase were varied, and stability was investigated. As the level of emulsifier agent (tween 80 and span 60) increased from 3% to 15%, and the percent of the internal phase remained constant at 30%, the particle size of the internal phase decreased and the cream became more stable. Formulations of the same composition, but prepared using Myrj 53 and tween 20 as emulsifiers, showed a larger particle size than formulations prepared using tween 80 and Brij 35. As the level of the internal phase volume increased and consequently the amount of water decreased, emulsion viscosity increased. The best formulation containing 30% internal phase (50% cetyl alcohol, 35% stearyl alcohol), 15% emulsifying agents (tween 80/span 60 ratio of 3:1), and 70% water was selected, and effects of process temperature and cooling rate on emulsion stability investigated. This formulation was further investigated in terms of stability of a 1% hydrocortisone addition by varying the percentage (30%, 35%, 40%, and 45%) of internal phase and percentage of water (70%, 65%, 60%, and 55%). The best formulation contained 45% internal phase (22.5 g cetyl alcohol, 15.75 g stearyl alcohol, 15% emulsifying agent, which is equivalent to 5 g tween 80 and 1.7 g span 60), and 55% w/w water, was manufactured under different manufacturing processes. Emulsions prepared by homogenization at the beginning of the process of emulsification were stable with small internal phase particle diameter. This study demonstrates that at every cetyl alcohol/stearyl alcohol ratio there is a phase volume/emulsifier HLB ratio, which results in optimum stability."}

Adequate dietary intake is essential as humans can not synthesize this vitamin. It has been reported that smokers require higher dietary intakes to maintain their serum levels. The objective of this study was to determine serum levels of ascorbic acid in young male smokers and non smokers in the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. In addition, their dietary intake of ascorbic acid was determined by a 24 h dietary recall. The dietary intake of ascorbic acid in 12 smokers was 64 +/- 11 mg/d and in 13 non smokers it was 70 +/- 12 mg/d. The smokers in this study did not meet the dietary recommendation of 100 mg/d. Serum ascorbic acid values in smokers and non smokers were 24.2 +/- 6.9 mumol/L and 30.9 +/- 3.7 mumol/L respectively. No significant difference was found among the 2 groups. Although the average serum ascorbic acid values fell within the range considered normal, 50% of the smokers had individual values that were below 23 mumol/L, indicating that these subjects have hipovitaminosis. A positive correlation between intake and serum levels was obtained for smokers (r = 0.71; p = 0.03). The results of this study suggest smokers may be at increased risk for chronic diseases due to their low intake and low serum levels of ascorbic acid."}

Maternity care has become more and more obstetrical care, focussed on pathology and complications. The involvement of general practitioners (GPs) in maternity care is strongly reduced and almost everywhere the same reasons are found: interference with lifestyle and interruption of office routine, fear of litigation and costs of malpractice insurance, insufficient training and insufficient numbers of cases to retain competency. In Canada, the USA, and to a lesser extent in Australia and New Zealand, GPs still providing intrapartum care are GP-obstetricians rather than maternity care providers. They provide low-risk as well as high-risk obstetrical care, especially in rural areas with few specialist obstetricians. In Europe, GPs do not provide high-risk obstetrical care. Instead they emphasize their role as generalist, and compete with midwives for a central role in maternity care for women with an uncomplicated pregnancy. The ongoing medicalisation of childbirth and the changing attitudes towards the demands of maternity care practice have diminished the role of GPs or family physicians. If they want to stay involved in maternity care in the future they need to cooperate with midwives, preferably in shared care programs."}

The estimated odds of giving sperm to a survivor were 1.07 times greater with every 1-year increase in age. The choice of sperm disposal was significantly related to the banking reason for the case of banking prior to chemotherapy and/or radiation for malignancy. In the case of male death, the decisions of couples undergoing IVF for embryo disposition agreed with choices of male patients for sperm disposition approximately 33% of the time more often than by chance alone. Decisions surrounding disposition of cryopreserved sperm are significantly associated with marital status, age, and reason for banking sperm.

Two forms of alpha complementation have been used in high throughput screening (HTS), in which interacting fragments complement with either low or high affinity. Low affinity complementation is used to monitor protein protein interactions, such as those occurring in homodimerization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and provides a robust screen for detection of EGFR inhibitors. High affinity complementation provides the basis for several HTS assays, in which analytes, such as cAMP or IP(3), are detected in crude cell lysates.

The algorithm for a spherical measurement configuration has recently been reported in another paper. Here, we extend the reconstruction algorithms to planar and cylindrical measurement configurations. First, we generalize the rigorous reconstruction formulas by employing Green's function technique. Then, in order to detect small (compared with the measurement geometry) but deeply buried objects, we can simplify the formulas when two practical conditions exist: 1) that the high-frequency components of the thermoacoustic signals contribute more to the spatial resolution than the low-frequency ones, and 2) that the detecting distances between the thermoacoustic sources and the detecting transducers are much greater than the wavelengths of the high-frequency thermoacoustic signals (i.e., those that are useful for imaging). The simplified formulas are computed with temporal back projections and coherent summations over spherical surfaces using certain spatial weighting factors. We refer to these reconstruction formulas as modified back projections. Numerical results are given to illustrate the validity of these algorithms."}

Restorative materials (Z250 and Z100; 3 M ESPE) placed by six operators were used for a total of 150 restorations during the 6-month enrollment period. After 1 year, 141 restorations (76 Z250 and 66 Z100) were available and evaluated for overall quality, color match, marginal adaptation, surface appearance and the presence of secondary caries, using modified USPHS criteria. The overall quality was excellent for both materials and no significant changes were noted during the follow-up. None of the scores between the two materials were statistically significant. Major changes were seen in color match and surface appearance. At baseline, the color match of 71% of Z250 and 62% of Z100 was rated as Alfa, after 1 year the figures were 60 and 65%. Regarding surface appearance, 97% of the Z250 were rated Alfa at baseline, whereas at 1 year the figure was 76%. For Z100, the scores were 94 and 79%, respectively. After 1 year, the clinical performance of Z250 restorative composite resin was clinically acceptable and similar to that of Z100."}

Susceptibility measurements of the tungsten(IV) complexes revealed an intrinsic paramagnetism of these compounds and evidenced different magnetic properties of the dimethylamino and methyl (R = NMe(2), Me) substituted tungsten(IV) compounds in solution and in the solid state. In dichloromethane solution, singlet ground states with thermally populated triplet states were observed, whereas triplet (R = Me) and singlet ground states (R = NMe(2)) were observed in the solid state. Using both experimental and theoretical techniques (DFT) allowed to establish solvation and ligand effects to account for the different magnetic behavior.

We and others [Furth, P. A., Choe, W. T., Rex, J. H., Byrne, J. C., and Baker, C. C. (1994) Mol. Cell. Biol. 14, 5278-5289] have previously shown that U1 small nuclear (sn) RNA, both natural or with 5' end mutations, can specifically inhibit reporter gene expression in mammalian cells. This inhibition occurs when the U1 snRNA 5' end base pairs near the polyadenylation signal of the reporter gene's pre-mRNA. This base pairing inhibits poly(A) tail addition, a key, nearly universal step in mRNA biosynthesis, resulting in degradation of the mRNA. Here we demonstrate that expression of endogenous mammalian genes can be efficiently inhibited by transiently or stably expressed 5' end-mutated U1 snRNA. Also, we determine the inhibitory mechanism and establish a set of rules to use this technique and to improve the efficiency of inhibition. Two U1 snRNAs base paired to a single pre-mRNA act synergistically, resulting in up to 700-fold inhibition of the expression of specific reporter genes and 25-fold inhibition of endogenous genes. Surprisingly, distance from the U1 snRNA binding site to the poly(A) signal is not critical for inhibition, instead the U1 snRNA must be targeted to the terminal exon of the pre-mRNA. This could reflect a disruption by the 5' end-mutated U1 snRNA of the definition of the terminal exon as described by the exon definition model."}

In this study small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with synchrotron radiation has been applied for in-situ characterisation during formation of polymeric membranes. The spinning of a polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fibre membrane was chosen for investigation of dynamic aggregation processes during membrane formation, because it allows the measurement of the dynamic equilibrium at different distances from the spinning nozzle. With this system it is possible to resolve structural changes in the nm-size range which occur during membrane formation on the time-scale of milliseconds. Integral structural parameters, like radius of gyration and pair-distance distribution, were determined. Depending on the chosen spinning parameters, e.g. the flow ratio between polymer solution and coagulant water, significant changes in the scattering curves have been observed. The data are correlated with the distance from the spinning nozzle in order to get information about the kinetics of membrane formation which has fundamental influence on structure and properties of the membrane."}

One of the main causes of disease is the unhygienic conditions of typical rural houses - two-room constructions with dirt floors and walls of lightly fired bricks or woven bamboo skins. While most houses have few or no windows, the occupants frequently cook, eat, sleep and even keep animals in a single room. The main objective of the housing improvement programme was to improve air circulation and introduce more sunlight to kill bacteria, avoid dampness and eliminate smoke from cooking. The programme encourages villagers to construct a permanent floor, enlarge existing windows or insert new windows for good ventilation. This presentation will share the 'success stories' of housing improvement projects in Indonesia that adopted demand-responsive approaches instead of the conventional 'supply approach'. Through exercises like Wealth Classification and Social Mapping, a demand-responsive approach lets the community decide who is eligible for assistance, resulting in higher participation and accurate information on community demand and on materials needed. In addition to the successes, the failures will be discussed at field level. This presentation will discuss the lessons learned from: the World Bank-funded Kalisemut Case Study; government's Family Welfare Movement; Plan International's project in Yogyakarta, and AusAID-funded Sustainable Development through Community Participation Project in Lombok."}

These experiments result in fast and accurate determinations of the relaxation rate, are relatively robust to pulse imperfections, and preserve information about the chemical shift. The method used in these experiments is to first encode the T1 values as a spatial variation of the magnetization and then to read out this variation either by applying a weak gradient during acquisition or by sequentially observing different slices of the sample. As a result, it is possible to reduce the time necessary to determine the T1 values by one or two orders of magnitude. This time saving comes at the expense of the signal-to-noise level of the resulting spectrum and some chemical shift resolution."}

Here, we provide the first complete map of ER export determinants of a type I membrane protein, ERGIC-53, that cycles in the early secretory pathway. ER export requires a phenylalanine motif at the C-terminus, known to mediate coat protein II (COPII) interaction, that is assisted by a glutamine in the cytoplasmic domain. Disulfide bond-stabilized oligomerization is also required. Efficient hexamerization depends on the presence of a polar and two aromatic residues in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Oligomerization becomes independent on disulfide bonds when TMD hydrophobicity is increased. ER export is also influenced by TMD length, 21 amino acids being most efficient. When transferred to a signal-less construct, the established targeting motifs reconstitute full transport activity. The results suggest an ER-export mechanism in which transmembrane and luminal determinants mediate oligomerization required for efficient recruitment of ERGIC-53 into budding vesicles via the C-terminal COPII-binding phenylalanine motif."}

Thirty-six (56%) out of 64 consecutive patients operated at our Institute during 1985-90 underwent endoscopy of the reservoir in the years 1994 and 1998. Functional outcome and macroscopic changes were recorded and histological samples taken from the three levels of the pelvic pouch. Acute and chronic inflammation were graded in accordance with a well-established histopathologic scoring system. The functional outcome was unchanged in 26 (72%), became worse in eight (22%) and better in two (6%) cases during follow up. The number of macroscopic changes increased during follow up and there was a tendency for them to become more common in the distal pouch. Microscopic acute and chronic inflammation decreased during follow up. There were more severe inflammatory changes in the distal pouch. Both acute and chronic inflammatory scores were higher through the reservoir in the cases of chronic pouchitis. Chronic pouchitis occurred more often in males. Macroscopic and inflammatory changes in the pelvic pouch seem to have separate progress during long-term follow up. In chronic pouchitis both acute and chronic inflammation are pronounced and spread over the entire pelvic pouch mucosa."}

These findings suggest that the youngest samples of depressed children who have FHBPD might be at very high risk for switching. The finding of a valid depressive syndrome in preschool children has raised the question of whether mania could also manifest at this early stage. We investigated FHBPD among three preschool study groups: a depressed group and two nondepressed comparison groups (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/oppositional defiant disorder, no disorder). Increased FHBPD was found among the depressed group. Based on this, we explored whether the depressed subgroup with FHBPD (MDD + FHBPD) had a unique constellation of depressive symptoms compared to the depressed subgroup without FHBPD (MDD with no FHBPD). The MDD + FHBPD group was found to have an increased frequency of the MDD symptom of \"restlessness and moves around a lot\" as compared with the MDD with no FHBPD group. The question of whether this symptom could be an early precursor of later mania was explored. These findings taken together suggest that early risk factors for switching to mania may be present in a subgroup of depressed preschoolers. Longitudinal follow-up of depressed preschool samples to determine rates of switching to mania later in development is critical to determine whether such findings represent early risk factors. Future studies that directly investigate age-appropriate mania manifestations in preschool samples are now warranted."}

Agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a nuclear hormone receptor that mediates anti-inflammatory actions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and thiazolidinediones, have been therefore proposed as a potential treatment of AD. Experimental evidence suggests that cortical noradrenaline (NA) depletion due to degeneration of the locus ceruleus (LC) - a pathological hallmark of AD - plays a permissive role in the development of inflammation in AD. To study a possible relationship between NA depletion and PPARgamma-mediated suppression of inflammation we investigated the influence of NA on PPARgamma expression in murine primary cortical astrocytes and neurons. Incubation of astrocytes and neurons with 100 micro m NA resulted in an increase of PPARgamma mRNA as well as PPARgamma protein levels in both cell types. These effects were blocked by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol but not by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine, suggesting that they might be mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. Our results indicate for the first time that PPARgamma expression can be modulated by the cAMP signalling pathway, and suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of NA on brain cells may be partly mediated by increasing PPARgamma levels. Conversely, decreased NA due to LC cell death in AD may reduce endogenous PPARgamma expression and therefore potentiate neuroinflammatory processes."}

When this mutant is exposed to visible light and oxygen there is a short lag period followed by exponential killing of the cells. The killing process obeys the Bunsen-Roscoe law of reciprocity and is temperature-independent. The chlorophyll content of the cells does not affect the rate of killing until a certain low threshold has been reached. Exposure of photosynthetically grown cells to air in the dark induces a temporary desensitization to the killing. A certain proportion of the population is invariably resistant to the photokilling. Evidence is presented to show that the resistance of these cells is probably a result of their abnormally low chlorophyll content. One consequence of the irradiation is the appearance of abnormally small colonies upon plating the survivors. This is interpreted in terms of a multi-hit theory. The photosensitizing pigment itself (the intracellular bacteriochlorophyll) is destroyed. The process is zero order, temperature-dependent, and does not follow the reciprocity law. It is suggested that the death of the cell results from a disruption of the cell membrane."}

Greater than 70% of the homocysteine in plasma is disulfide-bonded to protein cysteine residues. The identity and functional consequences of protein homocysteinylation are just now emerging. The amyloidogenic protein transthyretin (prealbumin), as we now report, undergoes homocysteinylation at its single cysteine residue (Cys10) both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, when human plasma or highly purified transthyretin was incubated with 35S-L-homocysteine followed by SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImaging, two bands corresponding to transthyretin dimer and tetramer were observed. Treatment of the labeled samples with beta-mercaptoethanol prior to SDS-PAGE removed the disulfide-bound homocysteine. Transthyretin-Cys10-S-S-homocysteine was then identified in vivo in plasma from normal donors, patients with end-stage renal disease, and homocystinurics by immunoprecipitation and high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometry. The ratios of transthyretin-Cys10-S-S-homocysteine and transthyretin-Cys10-S-S-sulfonate to that of unmodified transthyretin increased with increasing homocysteine plasma concentrations, whereas the ratio of transthyretin-Cys10-S-S-cysteine to that of unmodified transthyretin decreased. The hyperhomocysteinemic burden is thus reflected in the plasma levels of transthyretin-Cys10-S-S-homocysteine, which in turn may contribute to the pathological consequences of amyloid disease."}

The import of macromolecules in the malaria parasite has been the subject of many debates. To understand the import of macromolecules by the parasite, we studied the uptake of proteins by Plasmodium falciparum infected human erythrocyte. Proteins were biotin labelled individually, purified on a gel filtration column and added to uninfected and infected asynchronized culture. The uptake of these proteins by malaria parasites was determined by western blot analysis of parasite pellet and their different fractions using streptavidin-horseradish conjugate. To further confirm this import, we studied the uptake of 125I-labelled proteins by western blot analysis as well as used direct immunofluorescence method. Here we show that biotin labelled and radio-iodinated polypeptides of molecular sizes in the range of 45 to 206 kDa, when added in the culture medium, get direct access to the parasite membrane through a membrane network by by-passing the erythrocyte cytosol. The import of these polypeptides is ATP-dependent as sodium azide treatment blocks this uptake. We also show that malaria parasites have the ability to take up and degrade biotin labelled human serum albumin, which has been shown to be essential for the parasite growth. These results can be used, as a basis to explore the role of human serum albumin in the intraerythrocytic development of parasites, and this in turn can be an important adjunct to the development of novel antimalarial drugs."}

We explored an input regime in which excitation and inhibition had an ongoing baseline rate because both input pathways show ongoing activity in vivo. We found that spiking was time-locked to transients in the inputs, consisting of brief decreases in inhibitory or increases in excitatory conductance. Such input transients were caused by synchronization among multiple inputs. However, we found that temporal synchrony in the inhibitory input pathway had preferential access to the control of DCN spiking, because the large NMDA component of the excitatory inputs smoothed out temporal transients in this pathway. Thus, synaptic integration in the DCN appears to be tuned to allow the cerebellar cortical output from Purkinje cells preferential access to the control of DCN spiking. The effect of temporal modulations in the inhibition was further enhanced by the voltage dependence of the NMDA inputs. Thus, the presence of a baseline of mossy and climbing fiber inputs boosted depolarizing responses caused by reduced inhibition by the voltage-dependent increase in inward NMDA current. Overall, our results show that correlated activity or pauses in populations of Purkinje cells are well suited to the dynamic control of DCN spiking. In addition, strong transients in excitation can directly drive DCN responses that bypass cerebellar cortical processing."}

Seven cases were respiratory, including five cases requiring treatment, and two involved infected catheters and vascular conduits. Compared with nine cases of mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolated in the same period, NTM isolation occurred later after HSCT and involved more unrelated donors. Important risk factors for NTM infection included significant aGVHD (P=0.043), leukemia relapse (P=0.022), MUD and mismatch SCT (P<0.001) and existence of BO (P<0.001). Coinfection with aspergillus was common. Invasive NTM disease required prolonged antimicrobial treatment in five cases due to M. fortuitum and M. chelonae. With better MTB prophylaxis, intensive immunosuppression and better awareness, NTM has become an emerging threat in oriental allogeneic HSCT recipients. The cutoff between colonization and infection, and the threshold for starting treatment is unclear. NTM isolation is a marker for severe immunosuppression and poor prognosis.

Initially, the text frames the health sector in the sociodemographic context; it describes the past two decades of demographic changes noting particularly the very low birth rate and the growth in the proportion of the elderly. It also summarizes the main aggregate economic trends emphasizing the gross national product growth of near an annual 4% for the past 10 years and the decrease in the unemployment rate from high values of approximately 20% to half that rate in the same period, together with a stabilization of the inflation rate around 4%, still higher than EU average values. Second, this article describes the Spanish health sector organization and financing, underlining that it is mostly a publicly funded system (approximately 80% of total health-care expenditures are public) and that the universal coverage is financed out of general taxation after two decades of transition from social security-based premiums. Simultaneously to that universalization of the health-care rights, Spain started a political decentralization process in almost all the spheres of the public administration, health issues included. The article describes the changes in budgeting, management, and funding that nowadays fully belong to the regions. An essential part of the text is devoted to the pharmaceutical sector and its policies. Drug budgets represent almost 25% of the total public health expenditures; this proportion is approximately 50% of primary care expenditures. The incentive payments to achieve a more efficient prescription are approximately 2% of primary care physicians' gross salary. Doctors in hospitals have scarce incentives related to this issue. Some examples are presented of how this decentralization process affects the pharmaceutical policies that are designed and implemented by both the central and the regional governments. Regions are currently developing health technology assessment departments that will also perform activities on the economic evaluation of drugs. The planned reforms will still retain at the central government level the control of three major drug policies: authorization, pricing, and reimbursement. Several policies are currently focused on increasing the 6% share of generic drugs in the total drug market toward the EU average. The decentralization will allow the regions to modify some reimbursement policies and mainly to establish new incentives on prescription and purchasing procedures of drugs by the hospitals. The new drug agency is foreseen to assume the utilization of cost-effectiveness studies to provide economic information in the pricing and reimbursement processes."}

This article presents a clinical case in which a radiographic finding could be compatible with the presence of a nasopalatine or globulomaxillary cyst and a dens in dente. It was decided to extract the invaginated tooth, and by 15 days postextraction, the radiolucid area had completely disappeared. The complex surgery that would have been required to remove the patient's supposed cyst was thus avoided. Clinical and radiographic examination is suggested before making further decisions that could complicate treatment when a lesion is associated with other dental anomalies."}

N and P fractions in soil solutions and drainage streams were determined at monthly intervals over 1 year from Widdybank Fell, Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve, an upland area of northern England. Nitrogen was present in inorganic and organic forms at relatively high concentrations, whereas P was mainly organic, with inorganic P concentrations near the detection limit (1 microg Pl(-1)). The highest concentrations of organic P occurred in 'pulses' during the spring. These pulses may have originated in the soil following drying and rewetting cycles, and appear to demonstrate hydrochemical connectivity between soils and streams. Seasonal changes in N:P ratio were estimated in various ways to assess when the availability of these elements was likely to influence organisms. Based on inorganic nutrients alone, marked P limitation would be expected throughout the year, but inclusion of organic nutrients suggests that some communities may become N-limited during the spring. This agrees with known seasonal changes in the biology of the cyanobacterium Rivularia, which dominates the main drainage streams. Our data highlight the importance of including organic nutrients when assessing biological nutrient limitation."}

A retrospective analysis of all patients with selective endosaccular coil occlusion of intracranial aneurysms prospectively collected from 1992 to 2002 was performed. There were 501 aneurysms in 466 patients (mean+/-SD age, 54.20+/-12.54 years; 74% female). Aneurysms were acutely ruptured (54.1%) or unruptured (45.9%). Mean+/-SD aneurysm size was 9.67+/-5.91 mm with a 4.31+/-1.97-mm neck. The most frequent sites were basilar bifurcation (27.7%) and carotid ophthalmic (18.0%) aneurysms. Recurrences were subjectively divided into minor and major (ideally necessitating re-treatment). The most significant predictors of angiographic recurrence were determined by logistic regression. These results were confirmed by chi2, t tests, or ANOVAs followed, when appropriate, by Tukey's contrasts. Short-term (< or =1 year) follow-up angiograms were available in 353 aneurysms (70.5%) and long-term (>1 year) follow-up angiograms, in 277 (55%), for a total of 383 (76.5%) followed up. Recurrences were found in 33.6% of treated aneurysms that were followed up and that appeared at a mean+/-SD time of 12.31+/-11.33 months after treatment. Major recurrences presented in 20.7% and appeared at a mean of 16.49+/-15.93 months. Three patients (0.8%) bled during a mean clinical follow-up period of 31.32+/-24.96 months. Variables determined to be significant predictors (P<0.05) of a recurrence included aneurysm size > or =10 mm, treatment during the acute phase of rupture, incomplete initial occlusions, and duration of follow-up. Long-term monitoring of patients treated by endosaccular coiling is mandatory."}

These statistics suggest that first-degree relatives of patients with melanoma, who are at particularly high risk, warrant targeted public health action. We sought to document rates for dermatologist examinations for cutaneous lesions, the practice of skin self-examination, and sunscreen use in this at-risk group. Before participation in a randomized trial, 404 siblings of recently diagnosed patients with melanoma completed a survey on beliefs and practices regarding skin cancer prevention and detection. Sixty-two percent of participants had carefully examined their skin, 54% routinely used sunscreen, and 27% had received a skin cancer examination by a dermatologist during the past year; 47% had never received a dermatologist examination. Multivariate analysis found modifiable positive predictors for skin self-examination and dermatologist examinations, including having a clinician with whom to talk about melanoma and believing in the importance of regular skin examinations by a physician. Significant modifiable negative predictors included enjoyment of being tanned, not being sure what to look for when examining moles, and feeling uncomfortable having others look at their skin. Skin self-examination rates among these high-risk siblings are markedly higher than in population-based studies. However, many siblings were not screened for skin cancer by a dermatologist despite having strong risk profiles, being nearly fully insured, and being under care of primary care physicians. Improvements in communication between physicians and high-risk families and changes in office systems to assess family history of melanoma could increase screening rates for the estimated 1 million siblings of patients with melanoma."}

These children are subject to gross violations of their human rights, such as the right to protection from harm, violence and abuse. At least 300,000 children are currently being used to fight in armed conflicts in over 30 countries across the world. Girls and boys are abducted, coerced or persuaded to join armed forces, often in brutal circumstances. These children are usually involved in internal conflicts, where poverty and exclusion leave very few other viable options--becoming soldiers may appear to be their only means of survival. Many, however, sustain physical injuries and permanent disabilities as a result of combat and it is impossible to know how many are killed. A large number encounter health problems such as sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Lack of data on the health of child soldiers means that appropriate medical care and treatment may be inadequate or inaccessible, even during a planned demobilization. There is an urgent need for systematic research and data collection in order to better understand and provide for the healthcare of all children leaving armed groups."}

Because perinatal iron therapy is common, the presence of these tablets, which have a candylike appearence, in the home may pose a hazard to a mother's other young children. We explored the association between iron poisoning in young children and the birth of a sibling. We conducted a population-based case-control study linking health care databases in Ontario. Health care records for the mothers of children less than 3 years of age admitted to hospital with iron poisoning between Apr. 1, 1991, and Mar. 31, 2000, were compared with those for the mothers of age- and sex-matched control children without iron poisoning. We studied records for 40 children admitted to hospital for iron poisoning. Seventeen cases (42%) occurred within a year (before or after) a sibling's birth. Children whose mothers had given birth to a sibling were almost twice as likely as children whose mothers had not given birth to a sibling to be admitted for iron poisoning within 6 months of birth (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 3.9). The postpartum year was associated with a consistently elevated risk, including an almost 4-fold increase in the risk of iron poisoning during the first postpartum month (adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 0.8 to 16.5). Pregnancy is a major risk factor for iron poisoning in young children, and the period immediately after delivery is associated with the greatest risk. Almost half of all hospital admissions for iron poisoning in young children could be prevented by keeping iron supplements safely out of reach in the year before and after the birth of a sibling."}

We investigated the association between telomere length and cancer risk in four ongoing case-control studies. All studies had equal numbers of case patients and matched control subjects (92 for head and neck cancer, 135 for bladder cancer, 54 for lung cancer, and 32 for renal cell carcinoma). Telomere length was measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes from study participants. Genetic instability was assessed with the comet assay. Patient and disease characteristics were collected and analyzed for associations with risk for these cancers. All statistical tests were two-sided. Telomeres were statistically significantly shorter in patients with head and neck cancer (6.5 kilobases [kb]) than in control subjects (7.4 kb) (difference = 0.9 kb, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5 to 1.2 kb; P<.001). Nine percent of patients with head and neck cancer were in the longest quartile of telomere length, whereas 59% were in the shortest quartile. Similar patterns were observed for lung, renal cell, and bladder cancer. When subjects were categorized into telomere length quartiles defined by the distribution in control subjects, the following inverse relationship between telomere length and cancer risk was observed: adjusted odds ratios [ORs] for decreasing quartiles = 0.84 (95% CI = 0.36 to 1.97), 1.77 (95% CI = 0.72 to 4.36), and 5.11 (95% CI = 1.90 to 13.77). In stratified analysis, we found a suggestive greater-than-additive interaction between smoking status and telomere length: for ever smokers with short telomeres, OR = 25.05 (95% CI = 6.91 to 90.73); for never smokers with short telomeres, OR = 6.18 (95% CI = 1.72 to 22.13); and for ever smokers with long telomeres, OR = 6.49 (95% CI = 1.54 to 27.38). Telomere length was statistically significantly and inversely associated with baseline and mutagen-induced genetic instability. Short telomeres appear to be associated with increased risks for human bladder, head and neck, lung, and renal cell cancers."}

Topical fusidic acid is widely used in its treatment. There is concern that topical use of fusidic acid may be driving the selection and dissemination of fusidic acid-resistant (FusR) S. aureus. To test the hypothesis that treatment of atopic eczema for 2 weeks with topical fusidic acid/steroid combination can increase carriage of FusRS. aureus. Forty-six patients with atopic eczema were allocated randomly to one of two treatment groups. Group 1 (28 patients) were treated with topical 2% fusidic acid plus 0.1% betamethasone cream, and group 2 (18 patients) with topical 2% mupirocin and 0.1% betamethasone cream. The clinical response and nasal and skin colonization with S. aureus were recorded before treatment and after 1 and 2 weeks of therapy. Baseline samples from the site of worst eczema showed S. aureus (sensitive and resistant) in 76% of patients, and FusRS. aureus in 26%, with no significant difference between treatment groups. After 1 and 2 weeks, both groups showed similar significant clinical improvement. The overall median clinical improvement was paralleled by a reduction in prevalence and population density of S. aureus (sensitive and resistant) at the worst eczema site (P < 0.0001). However, for FusRS. aureus there was no significant change in the prevalence of carriage, or population density in either group compared to baseline. Over 50% of patients carried S. aureus in the nerves and over 20% carried FusRS. aureus. Neither regimen affected either the prevalence or population density of S. aureus or FusRS. aureus in the nerves. In this small study there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that short-term treatment of atopic eczema with fusidic acid/steroid combination increases fusidic acid resistant S. aureus during a 2-week period."}

The original stain SUG 2-2 grew in a Fe2+ medium containing 6 microM Hg2+ with a lag time of 22 days, but could not grow in a Fe2+ medium containing 10 microM Hg2+. In contrast, strain MON-1 could grow in a Fe2+ medium containing 20 microM Hg2+ with a lag time of 2 days and the ability of strain MON-1 to grow rapidly in a Fe2+ medium containing 20 microM Hg2+ was maintained stably after the strain was cultured many times in a Fe2+ medium without Hg2+. A similar level of NADPH-dependent mercury reductase activity was observed in cell extracts from strains SUG 2-2 and MON-1. By contrast, the amounts of mercury volatilized for 3 h from the reaction mixture containing 7 microM Hg2+ using a Fe(2+)-dependent mercury volatilization enzyme system were 5.6 nmol for SUG 2-2 and 67.5 nmol for MON-1, respectively, indicating that a marked increase of Fe(2+)-dependent mercury volatilization activity conferred on strain MON-1 the ability to grow rapidly in a Fe2+ medium containing 20 microM Hg2+. Iron oxidizing activities, 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) oxidizing activities and cytochrome c oxidase activities of strains SUG 2-2 and MON-1 were 26.3 and 41.9 microl O2 uptake/mg/min, 15.6 and 25.0 microl O2 uptake/mg/min, and 2.1 and 6.1 mU/mg, respectively. These results indicate that among components of the iron oxidation enzyme system, especially cytochrome c oxidase activity, increased by the acquisition of further mercury resistance in strain MON-1. Mercury volatilized by the Fe(2+)-dependent mercury volatilization enzyme system of strain MON-1 was strongly inhibited by 1.0 mM sodium cyanide, but was not by 50 nM rotenone, 5 microM 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxy-quinoline-N-oxide (HQNO), 0.5 microM antimycin A, or 0.5 microM myxothiazol, indicating that cytochrome c oxidase plays a crucial role in mercury volatilization of strain MON-1 in the presence of Fe2+."}

Introduction of methyl groups at the alpha-position of the vinyl group or the ortho positions of the phenyl results in increased phenyl-vinyl dihedral angles. Styrenes possessing both alpha-methyl and ortho-methyl groups adopt orthogonal geometries. Decreased planarity results in a progressive blue-shift in the lowest energy allowed pi,pi transition and a decrease in the singlet lifetime. Kinetic modeling of the temperature-dependent singlet lifetimes provides activation parameters for the activated decay pathway, which is assigned to C=C torsion for styrenes with phenyl-vinyl dihedral angles, phi, < 60 degrees. Planar styrenes have large torsional barriers (7 +/- 1 kcal/mol) and decay predominantly via intersystem crossing and fluorescence at room temperature. Styrenes with values of 30 degrees < phi < 60 degrees have smaller torsional barriers and decay predominantly via C=C torsion at room temperature. Highly nonplanar styrenes decay predominantly via relatively rapid, weakly activated intersystem crossing."}

This pilot study investigated patient satisfaction following restoration of mandibular shortened dental arches. Sixty subjects with mandibular shortened dental arches entered a randomized controlled trial comparing two types of mandibular prostheses: bilateral free-end saddle RPDs and distal cantilever resin-bonded fixed partial dentures (FPD). Patient satisfaction was assessed using self-administered questionnaires before (baseline), 3 months after, and 1 year after provision of new prostheses. Improvements in levels of general satisfaction with teeth, appearance of teeth, and perceived masticatory ability were significant for the FPD group. Significant improvements in perceived masticatory ability were noted for both groups. There were also significant improvements in perceived levels of comfort of mandibular prostheses in both groups. Changes in summary satisfaction scores indicated improved satisfaction for both treatment groups but suggested a larger clinical effect for the FPD group. Significant differences between treatment groups were not established. Patient-based outcomes reported suggested that resin-bonded cantilever FPDs are an effective means of restoring the shortened mandibular dental arch in terms of patient comfort and acceptance."}

The Climate, Hydrochemistry and Economics of Surface-water Systems (CHESS) project has taken the LOIS methodology forward by exploring possible impacts of climate change on the water quality of European rivers, with the purpose of informing future catchment management. This was achieved by the application of a standard modelling framework to a set of five European catchments located in Finland (River Vantaa), United Kingdom (Yorkshire Ouse), Belgium (Dender), Italy (Enza) and Greece (Pinios). Baseline conditions were simulated using existing meteorological data from the period 1961-1990, and in all cases the modelling framework was able to reproduce key features of the flow and water quality regimes of the study catchments. The modelling framework comprised two models. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate water and chemical fluxes, primarily nutrients and sediment, generated from diffuse areas and thereby provide sub-catchment inputs to an in-stream water quality model, the Quality Evaluation and Simulation Tool for River Systems (QUESTOR). QUESTOR integrated the diffuse runoff along the channel network, together with point source discharges from industry and sewage treatment works, and water abstractions for public supply, industry and agriculture. The modelling framework has been used for the baseline conditions, along with a set of six climate scenarios. These comprised four scenarios derived from different general circulation models (GCMs) representing the 2050s, and three scenarios from the same GCM representing the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, with one scenario in both groups. Results have been explored using a range of measures to reflect the different stakeholder interests within and beyond the catchment. The results reflect the variability in present day conditions (e.g. climate, soils, agriculture and industry), and the variability in the climate scenarios, both between-catchment and between-scenario. Specific examples are: the loss of the spring snowmelt causing high flows on the Vantaa; a decrease in the already very low summer flows on the Pinios; and significant seasonal changes in nutrient losses, even though the annual change is small."}

Complement was not necessary in the cold phase using PNH cells and a potent source of antibody, but complement was required to be present at some stage if hemolysis were to occur. Optimal conditions for the cold phase were at 1 degrees C. for 30 minutes at pH 7.4. Ca(++) ions were required. Hemolysis in the warm phase occurred within one minute, was optimal at 32 degrees C., and required Mg(++).

Early detection was defined as greater than 5 years between the first reported positive HIV test and an AIDS diagnosis. The associations between early detection and sociodemographic and behavioral factors were assessed for the period January 1997 through June 2002. Over the study period, only 20% (253/1268) of persons interviewed met the criterion for early detection. Early HIV detection was less likely for women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4, 0.9), blacks (AOR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.8), foreign-born Latinos (AOR = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1, 0.3), U.S.-born Latinos (AOR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.6, and heterosexuals (AOR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.7). Trends of increasing early detection with older age groups (p < 0.001) and higher educational levels (p < 0.001) were also observed. Our findings indicate an overall low level of early HIV detection and suggest that major sociodemographic and risk group disparities exist in the likelihood of early detection among HIV-infected persons in Los Angeles. These differences have important implications for reducing the level of community HIV transmission and for improving individual health outcomes among people with HIV. Aggressive efforts are needed to expand HIV testing and early detection for women, minorities, heterosexuals, younger age groups, and persons of lower education. Links to treatment and behavioral intervention programs should accompany such expanded testing efforts."}

These molecules constitute the lipid bilayer defining the outer confines of a cell, but also serve as the structural entities which confine subcellular components. Mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful tool useful for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of complex phospholipids, including glycerophospholipids and the sphingolipid, sphingomyelin. Collision induced decomposition of both positive and negative molecular ion species yield rich information as to the polar head group of the phospholipid and the fatty-acyl substituents esterified to the glycerophospholipid backbone. This review presents the current level of understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation of various product ions following collisional activation of molecular ion species generated by electrospray ionization of the common glycerophospholipids, including phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin, and sphingomyelin. Recent advances in the application of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization is also considered. Several applications of mass spectrometry applied to phospholipid analysis are presented as they apply to physiology as well as pathophysiology."}

Conventional methods such as looping and suspension of the target artery carry risk of coronary artery damage. Above all, these methods do not aid in retraction in coronary arteriotomy. Five mongrel dogs were used in this study. After intratracheal general anesthesia, median sternotomy was performed, and the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) were chosen as target vessels. To stabilize epicardium we passed the proximal portion of each coronary artery with a pledgeted suture parallel to the orientation of the coronary artery through the arteriotomy. After a similar suture was passed on the distal side, pledgets were placed on both sides of the incised coronary artery, and tourniquets were applied and snared just after opening of the target coronary artery for occlusion of proximal and distal flow. The tourniquets also were pulled up at an angle of 45 degrees on both sides for stabilization of the epicardium and retraction of the arteriotomy edges. All instances of snare-induced coronary occlusion and retraction were analyzed (10 coronary snares in 5 dogs, the RCA and the LAD of each dog being used). Flow in the coronary artery was stopped, and visualization of the arteriotomy was successful. We described a novel technique of temporary coronary artery stabilization and occlusion that provided simultaneous retraction in coronary arteriotomy. This procedure resulted in a clean and retracted operative field for suitable anastomosis even in the arteriotomy edges."}

We evaluated the trackability, flexibility, and conformability of 17 coronary stents using specific mechanical bench tests. The quantifications used a dynamometer for assessment of trackability (maximal strength) and flexibility (stiffness) and a 3D optical gauging machine for assessment of conformability (distance between stent and arterial wall in a curvature). The maximal strength (measuring the trackability) ranged respectively from 0.24 +/- 0.06 and 0.38 +/- 0.03 N (Seaquest) to 1.31 +/- 0.42 and 1.34 +/- 0.35 N (Carbostent), concerning respectively curvatures of 90 degrees (P < 0.0001) and 135 degrees (P < 0.0001). The stiffness (measuring the flexibility) ranged from 0.53 +/- 0.16 (Seaquest) to 1.28 +/- 0.10 N/mm (NIR Royal; P < 0.0001). The mean distance between stent and external curvature (external conformability) ranged from 0.15 +/- 0.06 mm (S7) to 0.57 +/- 0.4 mm (NIR Royal; P < 0.0001). The mean distance between stent and internal curve (internal conformability) ranged from 0.26 +/- 0.13 (S7) to 0.44 +/- 0.12 mm (S670; P < 0.0001).

It is involved in many cell functions such as mechanical signal transduction and maintenance of cell integrity. Among the three cytoskeletal components, intermediate filaments (the cytokeratin in epithelial cells) are the best candidates for this mechanical role. A model of the establishment of the cytokeratin network of an epithelial cell is proposed to study the dependence of its structural organization on extracellular mechanical environment. To implicitly describe the latter and its effects on the intracellular domain, we use mechanically regulated protein synthesis. Our model is a hybrid of a partial differential equation of parabolic type, governing the evolution of the concentration of cytokeratin, and a set of stochastic differential equations describing the dynamics of filaments. Each filament is described by a stochastic differential equation that reflects both the local interactions with the environment and the non-local interactions via the past history of the filament. A three-dimensional simulation model is derived from this mathematical model. This simulation model is then used to obtain examples of cytokeratin network architectures under given mechanical conditions, and to study the influence of several parameters."}

However, apoptotic thymocytes are not usually found in the thymus, indicating that apoptotic thymocytes must be eliminated rapidly by scavengers. Although macrophages and dendritic cells are believed to play such role, little is known about scavengers in the thymus. We found that CD4(+)/CD11b(+)/CD11c(-) cells were present in the thymus and that they expressed costimulatory molecules for T cell selection and possessed Ag-presenting activity. Moreover, these CD4(+)/CD11b(+) cells phagocytosed apoptotic thymocytes much more efficiently than thymic CD4(-)/CD11b(+) cells as well as activated peritoneal macrophages. CD4(+)/CD11b(+) cells became larger along with thymus development, while no such change was observed in CD4(-)/CD11b(+) cells. Finally, engulfed nuclei were frequently found in CD4(+)/CD11b(+) cells. These results strongly suggest that thymic CD4(+)/CD11b(+) cells are major scavengers of apoptotic thymocytes."}

These assays are based on the interaction of specific phosphoinositide binding proteins with fluorophore-labeled phosphoinositide and inositol phosphate tracers. Enzyme reaction products are detected by their ability to compete with the fluorescent tracers for protein binding, leading to an increase in the amount of free tracer and a decrease in polarization (mP) values. A variety of fluorophore-labeled tracers were evaluated, and assay sensitivity and specificity for products of PI 3-K and SHIP2 activity was determined. Assay performance was evaluated using recombinant PI 3-Kalpha and SHIP2 with diC(8)-PI(4,5)P(2) and diC(8)-PI(3,4,5)P(3) as respective substrates. IC(50) values for previously characterized PI 3-K inhibitors were within expected ranges. These assays are homogeneous, sensitive, and rapid, and suitable for HTS applications, and will facilitate screening for novel inhibitors of phosphoinositide kinases and phosphatases in drug development."}

The current model has a more detailed environmental description than previous multi-species models in order to give a more accurate description of environmental fate. Improvements to the model environment include stratified air, soil and sediment compartments, the inclusion of a vegetation compartment, and the separation of the aerosol phase from the gas phase of the atmosphere. Such detailed environmental descriptions are particularly valuable when chemical heterogeneity is expected within environmental media as occurs with more reactive chemicals or local-scale simulations. The HR-MS model is illustratively applied to two situations for which a detailed environmental description is needed to describe the chemical fate accurately. The first example is the estimation of the atmospheric concentrations of malathion and its degradation product malaoxon following a local-scale application. The second example is a regional simulation of pentachlorophenol, which benefits from the more detailed treatment of ionizing chemical in the atmosphere. In both these cases, the HR-MS model is shown to be in good agreement with observed field data and provides a more accurate description of environmental fate than simpler multi-species models."}

Previous clinical reports and studies on infant rats have documented many Citrobacter-filled macrophages within the ventricles and brain abscesses. It has been hypothesized that intracellular survival and replication within macrophages may be a mechanism by which C. koseri subverts the host response and elicits chronic infection, resulting in brain abscess formation. In this study, we showed that C. koseri causes meningitis and brain abscesses in the neonatal rat model, and we utilized histology and magnetic resonance imaging technology to visualize brain abscess formation. Histology and electron microscopy (EM) revealed that macrophages (and not fibroblasts, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or neurons) were the primary target for long-term C. koseri infection. To better understand C. koseri pathogenesis, we have characterized the interactions of C. koseri with human macrophages. We found that C. koseri survives and replicates within macrophages in vitro and that uptake of C. koseri increases in the presence of human pooled serum in a dose-dependent manner. EM studies lend support to the hypothesis that C. koseri uses morphologically different methods of uptake to enter macrophages. FcgammaRI blocking experiments show that this receptor primarily facilitates the entry of opsonized C. koseri into macrophages. Further, confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that C. koseri survives phagolysosomal fusion and that more than 90% of intracellular C. koseri organisms are colocalized within phagolysosomes. The ability of C. koseri to survive phagolysosome fusion and replicate within macrophages may contribute to the establishment of chronic central nervous system infection including brain abscesses."}

Intralesionally applied radioimmunotherapy is a possible therapeutical option with the potential to improve survival of patients with malignant glioma. We investigated side effects and survival after surgery, conventional radiotherapy and additional radioimmunotherapy with labelled tenascin-antibodies in patients with malignant glioma. Since 1995, 37 patients were treated with radioimmunotherapy after resection and radiotherapy of a malignant glioma. Patients received antibodies labelled with yttrium-90 and iodine-131 in different doses into the tumour cavity via a previously implanted ommaya-reservoir. Treatment was applied in up to 8 cycles (mean 2.96 cycles) in time intervals of 6-8 weeks. Mean age was 46 years, histology was anaplastic astrocytoma in 13 patients and glioblastoma in 24 patients. For the whole group median survival time has not yet been reached. For glioblastoma the median survival time is 17 months, 5-year survival probability for anaplastic astrocytoma is 85% approximately. Quality of life was acceptable. Acute side effects following treatment were headache, seizures and worsening of pre-existing neurological symptoms. Late side effects were skin necrosis and, in 1 case, a delayed aphasia probably due to a vascular lesion. Radioimmunotherapy prolonged survival time in a selected group of patients with malignant gliomas as compared to a historical control group. Patients with anaplastic astrocytomas seem to have more benefit from this therapy than patients with glioblastomas."}

This gene encodes a dual specificity protein kinase that catalyzes its autophosphorylation on serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. But, the functions of the MNB/DYRK1A gene in cellular processes are unknown. In this study, we examined HeLa cells transfected with cDNA encoding a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-MNB/DYRK1A fusion protein and found 2 patterns of expression: In one group of transfected cells, GFP-MNB/DYRK1A was localized as dots within the nucleus; and in the other group, it was overexpressed and had accumulated all over the nucleus. In the cells overexpressing GFP-MNB/DYRK1A, multinucleation was clearly observed; whereas in those with the nuclear dots, such aberrant nuclei were not found. Furthermore, in the latter cells, essential processes such as mitosis and cytokinesis occurred normally. Multinucleation was dependent on the kinase activity of MNB/DYRK1A, because it was not observed in cells overexpressing kinase activity-negative mutants, GFP-MNB/DYRK1A (K179R) and GFP-MNB/DYRK1A (Y310F/Y312F). Immunostaining of GFP-MNB/DYRK1A-overexpressing cells with specific antibodies against alpha- and gamma-tubulin revealed that multiple copies of centrosomes and aberrant multipolar spindles were generated in these cells. These results indicate that overexpression of MNB/DYRK1A induces multinucleation in HeLa cells through overduplication of the centrosome during interphase and production of aberrant spindles and missegregation of chromosomes during mitosis."}

Our experimental design included anesthetized as well as chronically implanted guinea pigs. The cross-correlation, spike trigger averaging, between the medullary neurons firing, or the R-wave of the electrocardiogram, or hippocampal units, and theta rhythm revealed phase-locking during epochs of wakefulness, slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep, and under anesthesia. A special case was paradoxical sleep, an epoch known to lack autonomic function control (open-loop), in which a great majority of the recorded units (83%) exhibited theta phase-locking. The experimental control was a flat cross-correlation after unit firing shuffling. A brain-stem autonomic oscillator, together with a hypothalamic and a cortico-frontal centers entrained by baroreceptor input, have been proposed as the heart rhythm control system. The present report suggests that hippocampal theta waves may participate, in coordination with the hypothalamic center, as a heart rate modulator."}

Measurements of sap flux density (JS) were made prior to CO2 enrichment (summer 2000) and throughout the first whole growing season of CO2 exposure (2001) using the constant heat-flow technique. The short-term responses of sap flux to brief (1.5-3 h) interruptions of CO2 enrichment were also examined. There were no significant a priori differences in morphological and physiological traits between trees which were later exposed to elevated CO2 (n=14) and trees later used as controls (n=19). Over the entire growing season, CO2 enrichment resulted in an average 10.7% reduction in mean daily JS across all species compared to control trees. Responses were most pronounced in Carpinus, Acer, Prunus and Tilia, smaller in Quercus and close to zero in Fagus trees. The JS of treated trees significantly increased by 7% upon transient exposure to ambient CO2 concentrations at noon. Hence, responses of the different species were, in the short term, similar in magnitude to those observed over the whole season (though opposite because of the reversed treatment). The reductions in mean JS of CO2-enriched trees were high (22%) under conditions of low evaporative demand (vapour pressure deficit, VPD <5 hPa) and small (2%) when mean daily VPD was greater than 10 hPa. During a relatively dry period, the effect of elevated CO2 on JS even appeared to be reversed. These results suggest that daily water savings by CO2-enriched trees may have accumulated to a significantly improved water status by the time when control trees were short of soil moisture. Our data indicate that the magnitude of CO2 effects on stand transpiration will depend on rainfall regimes and the relative abundance of the different species, being more pronounced under humid conditions and in stands dominated by species such as Carpinus and negligible in mono-specific Fagus forests."}

Patient perception was also recorded. In all there were 68 high tibial osteotomies (HTOs), of which 40 were performed by Maquet's dome method and 28 were done by closing wedge osteotomy. Average follow up was 8.6 years (range: 5.2 to 13 years) and 16 (23.5%) cases went on to have total knee arthroplasty after an average interval of 3.7 years. The results of the two methods are compared. Average preoperative HTO alignment was a varus of 4.72 degrees and average postoperative HTO alignment was a valgus of 1.48 degrees. The average radiological grade of osteoarthritis and compartments affected was comparable in the two groups. Overall 35 (51.5%) patients were dissatisfied with their results. A larger percentage of people (57.5%) who had a Maquet's dome osteotomy were unhappy with their operation as compared to 42.9% of people who were unhappy following a closing wedge osteotomy. There was consistent undercorrection after dome osteotomy, with an average alignment of a varus of 1.45 degrees compared to a valgus of 5.67 degrees after a closing wedge procedure. The preoperative subluxation was greater in the patients with a relatively poor result, 3.86 mm compared to 2.03 mm in those with a good result. It is felt that the rather poor results following osteotomy in this series was due to insufficient correction obtained and the advanced stage of osteoarthritis resulting in subluxation. In this series the correction obtained with closing wedge method was better than with the dome method, although it was inadequate with both methods. Although the wedges appeared to do better than the domes, this was not statistically significant. Overall, there was no significant correlation of our results with post osteotomy alignment. Preoperative lateral tibial subluxation was, however, a poor prognosticator of results."}

Atrophy of disuse may take place concomitantly, either proximal, adjacent to or distal to the denervation muscular atrophy. The degree of atrophy of disuse depends upon the severity of the nerve lesion. Clinically, it is difficult to determine where true denervation muscular atrophy ends and accompanying atrophy of disuse begins. In such circumstances a clinician may be misled into belief that the cause of so apparently extensive a lesion is elsewhere. The patient then is often submitted to other complex diagnostic procedures and treatments. This difficulty can usually be dissipated by the use of electromyography, for each specific type of muscular atrophy produces its own characteristic electromyographic changes. Disuse atrophy produces no changes in electrical activity, whereas denervation atrophy manifests itself by typical denervation activity. Moreover it is possible to determine what part of muscular atrophy in a given area is owing to damage to a nerve and what part is owing only to disuse without denervation."}

Women reported more distress on several measures than men, and disability severity was also associated with depression and impaired social functioning. Family members with a greater negative orientation may be at risk to develop psychological and health problems upon assuming a caregiver role.

The objective of the study was to assess the incidence, location, and predictors of bleeding in the 2 treatment groups. A total of 1,222 patients were assigned to a TEE guided or conventional strategy and followed over 8 weeks. We present data on major and minor adjudicated bleeding complications for the 2 study groups during the 8-week study period. Composite major and minor bleeding complications occurred in 51 of 1,222 patients (4.2%) and were significantly lower in the TEE guided group compared with the conventional group (2.9 vs 5.5%, p = 0.025). The TEE group had fewer cancellations of cardioversion as a result of bleeding (0% vs 0.7%, p = 0.003). Major (n = 14) and minor (n = 38) bleeding complications were predominantly gastrointestinal (71.4% and 31.6%, respectively) and were associated with warfarin use. Predictors of bleeding included patient age, conventional group assignment, inpatient status, and functional status. Thus, composite major and minor bleeding complications occurred in 4.2% of the 1,222 patients and were significantly lower in the TEE guided group compared with the conventional group. Treatment variables affecting length of anticoagulant therapy in the conventional arm combined with advancing age and functional status are important concerns in patients who undergo cardioversion of atrial fibrillation."}

Characterizing roles of individual TRAFs has been hampered by limitations of available experimental models and the poor viability of most TRAF-deficient mice. Here, B cell lines made deficient in TRAF2 using a novel homologous recombination system reveal new roles for TRAF2. We demonstrate that TRAF2 participates in synergy between CD40 and B cell antigen receptor signals, and in CD40-mediated, TNF-dependent IgM production. We also find that TRAF2 participates in the degradation of TRAF3 associated with CD40 signaling, a role that may limit inhibitory actions of TRAF3. Finally, we show that TRAF2 and TRAF6 have overlapping functions in CD40-mediated NF-kappaB activation and CD80 up-regulation. These findings demonstrate previously unappreciated roles for TRAF2 in signaling by TNF receptor family members, using an approach that facilitates the analysis of genes critical to the viability of whole organisms."}

These findings imply that an input image can be efficiently represented by ICA bases. An application of image matching in the navigation by ICA is shown that the animal visual system method is indeed better than those classical methods at least more than 5%."}

In male patients with essential hypertension (EH; n = 36) as the only cardiovascular risk factor and normotensive controls (n = 12), blood flow was measured in the forearm circulation in response to i.a. infusion of synthetic human ANP, acetylcholine, orciprenaline, and sodium nitroprusside by strain-gauge venous plethysmography. In blood samples, cyclic guanosine'5-monophosphate (cGMP) and ANP concentrations were measured at resting conditions and during exogenous ANP infusion. In 200 patients with EH, genomic DNA was screened for an inhibitory deletion mutation of the GC-A gene, which has been recently linked to EH in a Japanese cohort. The vasodilatations in response to ANP and acetylcholine were impaired in the forearm circulation of patients with EH, whereas the responses to orciprenaline and nitroprusside were preserved. Plasma ANP and cGMP concentrations were increased in the patients with EH both at resting conditions and during ANP infusion; the resting plasma cGMP levels correlated significantly with the plasma ANP levels (r = 0.68). A specific deletion mutation of the GC-A gene did not account for the diminished relaxant effects of ANP in our study population. The vascular ANP/GC-A pathway is altered in patients with EH, in addition to the known defects on the nitric oxide/cGMP pathway. Attenuation of the vasodilative responses to ANP suggests impaired receptor or postreceptor responsiveness of GC-A. It is possible that this dysfunction participates in the pathomechanism of EH."}

In fetal tachyarrhythmias, however, visual analysis of FHR variability is limited. We therefore applied power spectral analysis of FHR to evaluate the fetal state. Fetal R-R intervals were detected by means of an external ECG in 3 fetuses with supraventricular extrasystoles after cardiac malformations had been excluded by fetal echocardiography. Using an autoregressive model, power spectral densities were calculated from 20 consecutive 256-beat segments for the following frequency bands: <0.03 Hz (very low frequency), 0.03-0.069 Hz (low frequency; LF), 0.07-0.129 Hz (mid-frequency) and 0.13-1.0 Hz (high frequency; HF). The FHR variability in fetal supraventricular extrasystoles mainly resulted from the HF component (63.91 +/- 6.97%). The sympatho-vagal balance (LF/HF) was decreased in the tracings with extrasystoles (0.13). The analysis of FHR variability in fetal supraventricular extrasystoles revealed an imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation."}

Vapors and aerosols of these lubricants are suspected to induce airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in exposed workers. In a previous study the authors demonstrated that water-soluble lubricants induce AHR after acute exposure of rabbits to concentrations near the German MAK value (10 mg/m(3)). In the present investigation the influence of a fatty alcohol as special non-water-soluble cooling lubricant was examined to determine its influence on airway responsiveness (AR). The effects of an aerosolized non-water-soluble lubricant (40, 90, and 220 mg/m(3)) on AR to acetylcholine in a rabbit model were studied. Lubricant atmosphere analysis was performed with infrared spectroscopy. Before exposure, after 2 and 4 hours of application, AR to aerosols from 0.2 and 2% acetylcholine was tested. Basal airway and cardiovascular parameters as well as blood gases did not change during exposure. Lubricant aerosol concentration of 40 and 220 mg/m(3) for 4 hours did not significantly alter AR. Inhalation of 90 mg/m(3) lubricant increased contractile response to ACH significantly. In contrast to formerly investigated water-soluble cooling lubricants, the examined non-water-soluble lubricant did not increase AR in concentrations near the MAK; however, in higher concentrations a significant (p<.05) increase was obtained."}

The algorithm allows to simulate systems whose dynamics is described by the Navier-Stokes and the convection-diffusion equations. The interplay between several time scales produces a rich and complex phenomenology. We investigate the effects of different oscillation frequencies and viscosities on the morphology of the phase separating domains. We find that at high frequencies the evolution is almost isotropic with growth exponents 2/3 and 1/3 in the inertial (low viscosity) and diffusive (high viscosity) regimes, respectively. When the period of the applied shear flow becomes of the same order of the relaxation time T(R) of the shear velocity profile, anisotropic effects are clearly observable. In correspondence with nonlinear patterns for the velocity profiles, we find configurations where lamellar order close to the walls coexists with isotropic domains in the middle of the system. For particular values of frequency and viscosity it can also happen that the convective effects induced by the oscillations cause an interruption or a slowing of the segregation process, as found in some experiments. Finally, at very low frequencies, the morphology of domains is characterized by lamellar order everywhere in the system resembling what happens in the case with steady shear."}

Materials and Methods Review of the evidence on breast cancer mortality reduction and discussion of the causes of difference in point estimates in the five Swedish and Canadian trials. A summary of the prerequisites for methodological quality and its available evidence from the trials is given. Data to support breast cancer mortality as a correct outcome measure are presented. There is no reason not to use breast cancer mortality as an outcome measure for trials intended to reduce breast cancer mortality, both from a clinical and a methodological point of view. Everything possible was performed in these trials in order to determine this outcome measure as accurately as possible. The fact that a few of the trials showed a relatively large breast cancer mortality reduction and others far lower reduction rates is irrelevant, if one does not consider the background situation in the region before the trial started, the design of the trial or quality of screening. There seems no reason to change or halt the current nation-wide population-based screening programmes. Nor is there any justifiable reason for negative reports towards women or professionals."}

In our study, a number of centers used a standardized training approach, in 1 week courses, to investigate the learning curve improvement that can be achieved with a group of beginners in upper gastroduodenal endoscopy. The multicenter study used the Erlangen Endo-Trainer, with specially prepared biological specimens from pigs. Using this, the individual steps of diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy can be carried out following a score-card system. After a theoretical introduction and a demonstration of the examination by an experienced endoscopist, an initial evaluation score for each participant was obtained on day 1. On the following days, the program consisted of 2 hours' training by a tutor, followed by a test run for each participant. On days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 the test run was directly followed by a self-assessment. In addition, on days 1, 3, and 5 the test run for each beginner was recorded on video, with each video assigned an encrypted code number. All the end of the study week, control assessments of these videos were carried out by an experienced endoscopist. Both the self-assessments and the control assessments showed significant improvements in the endoscopic parameters tested during the course (days 1-5; all parameters P < 0.001, Wilcoxon-test). However, it was found that the trainees tended to give themselves better marks than the marks given by experienced endoscopists. During 1 week of training, using the model and following the score card, a significant improvement in the learning curve was achieved in the beginners' group for the individual steps involved in diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. When this approach is used with trainees who are also provided with the necessary theoretical background, this type of preparation may lead to a better, lower-risk start to supervised practical endoscopic examinations in patients."}

A numerical model of an aquifer-derived laboratory microcosm is developed to simulate the dynamic behavior of fermentation and respiration in groundwater by coupling microbial growth and substrate utilization kinetics with a formulation that also includes aqueous speciation and other geochemical reactions including surface complexation, mineral dissolution, and precipitation. The model is used to test approaches that currently make use of H2(aq) to diagnose prevalent TEAPs in groundwater. Competition between TEAPs is integral to the conceptual model of the simulation, and the results indicate that competitive exclusion is significant but with some overlap found in the temporal sequence of TEAPs. Steady-state H2(aq) concentrations observed during different TEAPs do not differ significantly. The results are not consistent with previous applications of the partial equilibrium approach since most TEAP redox pairs exhibit free energies that suggest a particular process is able to proceed, yet observations here show that this process does not proceed."}

The subjective pink threshold used in judging pink discoloration was established at a* = 3.8. Samples of three color groups (normal, lighter than normal, and darker than normal) of boneless, skinless chicken breast muscles were selected based on instrumental color values. The in situ changes were induced using sodium chloride, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium erythorbate, and sodium nitrite at two levels: present and not present. Fillets in all treatments were subjected to individual injections, followed by tumbling, cooking, and chilling. Samples were analyzed for color [lightness (L*), red/green axis (a*), yellow/blue axis (b*)] and reflectance spectra. Simulation of the pink defect was achieved in eight of the 16 treatment combinations when sodium nitrite was present and in an additional two treatment combinations when it was absent. Pinking in cooked samples was affected (P < 0.05) by L* of raw meat color. Results confirmed that it was possible to simulate the undesired pinking in cooked chicken white meat when in situ conditions were induced by sodium chloride, sodium tripolyphosphate, and sodium nitrite. The continuation of the simulation study can aid in developing alternative processing methods to eliminate potential pink defects."}

While the majority of these patients respond initially to chemotherapy, most have disease relapse at the same site within a year. We report the results of a phase II study exploring the potential benefit of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection in patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in whom disease has shown a significant response to chemotherapy. A total of 11 patients with biopsy proven metastatic transitional cell carcinoma in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes and no evidence of visceral metastatic disease in whom disease showed a significant response to chemotherapy underwent complete bilateral retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. The end point of study was disease specific survival, calculated from the time of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection to death from transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Four patients underwent delayed retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Seven patients underwent concurrent cystectomy, and pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. There was no perioperative mortality. Nine patients had evidence of residual disease in the retroperitoneal nodes. Seven patients have recurrence outside of the original surgical field with a median time to recurrence of 7 months and 6 died at a median time to death of 8 months (range 5 to 14). One patient with retrocrural recurrence attained a complete response to salvage chemotherapy and remained disease-free 57 months after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. For all 11 patients median disease specific and recurrence-free survival rates were 14 and 7 months, respectively. Four-year disease specific and recurrence-free survival rates were 36% and 27%, respectively. We stratified the patients based on the number of involved lymph nodes at retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and noted that viable tumor in no more than 2 lymph nodes correlated with greater disease specific and recurrence-free survival (p = 0.006 and 0.01, respectively). Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection can be safely performed for metastatic transitional cell carcinoma. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection has curative potential, particularly in patients with viable tumor in no more than 2 lymph nodes after chemotherapy."}

Combining the superior anatomical resolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the physiologic information of PET could be an important advance for clinical and research applications of PET. The purpose of this study was to develop reliable methods for using MRI in the definition of brain regions of interest (ROIs) for application to coregistered PET brain images. First, specific criteria were developed for definition of ROIs on coregistered MRI using anatomical landmarks from a standard anatomical atlas. ROIs were then drawn by three independent raters using the criteria on 11 MRI scans, which had been coregistered to PET [(18)F]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) brain scans. These MRI-based templates were used to determine activity in various brain regions on the PET scans, which were used in the determination of regional brain metabolic rates. There was a high level of agreement between raters for the measurement of regional metabolic rates, with intra-class correlation coefficients ranging from 0.63-0.98. These findings suggest that specific ROI criteria based on coregistered MRI are a reliable method of measuring activity from PET images. The use of a standard and widely available atlas and readily applicable criteria for ROIs should facilitate a standard method of measurement which can be applied in a similar manner at different PET sites."}

The experimental design was an incomplete 3 x 2 factorial, with three levels of soybean oil (SBO; 0, 4, and 8% of diet DM) and two levels of forage (20 vs. 40% of diet DM). Forty Angus x Hereford steers averaging 504 +/- 29.0 kg were allotted randomly to one of four treatments for the last 6 wk of the finishing period. Treatments were: 80:20 concentrate:forage control diet (C); 80:20 concentrate:forage + 4% SBO (C4); 60:40 concentrate:forage + 4% SBO (F4); and 60:40 concentrate:forage + 8% SBO (F8). After 42 d on the experimental diets, steers were sacrificed and samples were collected from the chuck, loin, and round muscle groups. Fatty acid (FA; mg/100 mg of FA) composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Data were statistically analyzed with mixed models procedures. The performance and carcass quality model included the effects of SBO and forage. The model for FA composition included the effects of SBO, forage, muscle group, and interactions. Orthogonal contrasts were used to determine linear effects of SBO. There were no differences in growth performance among treatments (P > 0.05). Increasing dietary SBO linearly decreased dressing percent (P = 0.04), and tended to linearly decrease marbling score (P = 0.12) and quality grade (P = 0.08). The only CLA isomer detected in tissue samples was cis-9,trans-11. Addition of SBO to diets linearly increased linoleic acid (18:2n-6; P = 0.04) and tended to linearly increase linolenic acid (18:3n-3; P = 0.10) in muscle tissues. The CLA in lean tissues was decreased (P = 0.005) with SBO-containing diets. These findings suggest that increased PUFA may limit ruminal production of CLA and trans-vaccenic acid (VA) and/or may depress stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression or activity in lean tissues, which in turn limits CLA formation and accretion in tissues. Increasing dietary forage tended to increase 18:0, 18:2n-6, CLA, and 18:3n-3 (P < 0.15), suggesting that increased forage may mitigate toxic effects of PUFA on ruminal biohydrogenation, thereby increasing the pool of CLA and VA available for CLA formation and accretion in tissues. Short-term feeding of elevated SBO and forage levels can alter FA profiles in muscle tissues."}

This study examined the roles of cyclooxygenase-1/cyclooxygenase-2 in the enhanced renal vasoconstrictor effect of arachidonic acid in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Release of 20-HETE was also determined, as this eicosanoid has been reported to elicit cyclooxygenase-dependent vasoconstriction. We confirmed that vasoconstrictor responses to arachidonic acid were enhanced in the diabetic rat kidney associated with a 2-fold-greater increase in the release of 6-ketoPGF1alpha, which was used as an index of cyclooxygenase activity. One and three micrograms of arachidonic acid increased perfusion pressure by 85+/-37 and 186+/-6 mm Hg, respectively, in diabetic rat kidneys compared with 3+/-1 and 17+/-8 mm Hg, respectively, in control rat kidneys. Inhibition of both cyclooxygenase isoforms with indomethacin (10 micromol/L) abolished the vasoconstrictor response to arachidonic acid in both diabetic and control rat kidneys, whereas inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 with nimesulide (5 micromol/L) reduced perfusion pressure responses to 1 and 3 microg arachidonic acid only in the diabetic rat kidney to 15+/-8 and 108+/-26 mm Hg, respectively, consistent with a 3-fold increase in the renal cortical expression of cyclooxygenase-2. 20-HETE release from the diabetic rat kidney was reduced almost 6-fold and was not increased in response to arachidonic acid. These results demonstrate that the renal vasoconstrictor effect of arachidonic acid is solely dependent on cyclooxygenase activity, with no evidence for a contribution from 20-HETE; in the diabetic rat, cyclooxygenase-2 activity contributes to the renal vasoconstrictor effect of arachidonic acid."}

This study compares SNP-induced chondrocyte death and SNP-activated signaling mechanisms with apoptosis induced by CD95 activation. Sodium nitroprusside increased cell death dose-dependently. Compared to CD95 stimulation, SNP induced only low levels of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation as measured by cell-death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). However, SNP caused substantial nuclear DNA cleavage, as evidenced by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick end-labeling (TUNEL). Caspase-3 processing in response to SNP was not detected. The pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD.FMK partially abrogated the TUNEL signal but did not block cell death or internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The caspase-3-specific inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO did not inhibit the SNP-induced TUNEL signal or internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. DNA degradation was not blocked by the p38 inhibitor SB 202190 but by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the phenotype and mechanisms of SNP-induced chondrocyte death are distinct from apoptosis induction via CD95."}

Concerns regarding these patients' polypharmacy, duration of treatment, and risk of long-term or undetected side effects led to their being contacted with a view to the discontinuation of conventional antipsychotic treatment. All case notes were scrutinized to validate, as far as possible, the diagnosis of unipolar depression without psychotic features. Patients were invited for a review of their medication. Ratings of symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), motor side effects (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale), and personal function (Independent Living Skills Survey) were made before and after conventional antipsychotic discontinuation. The study was conducted Autumn 1999-Spring 2000. None of the 55 patients were deemed to present comorbid depression secondary to any other diagnosis. One patient could not be contacted; 14 patients, who tended to be older, refused the review. Of the remaining 40 who were seen, 25 had already discontinued antipsychotic treatment; their chronicity of illness was half that of the 15 patients continuing antipsychotic treatment. However, only 11 of these 25 patients had their medications discontinued under consultant psychiatrist supervision following the audit; 14 patients had stopped medication of their own volition, or for unclear reasons. Of the remaining 15 patients, 13 had their conventional antipsychotic discontinued by us. There were clinically and statistically significant improvements in symptoms and side effects after antipsychotic treatment was discontinued, and a statistically significant improvement in personal health care function. In this small sample, discontinuation of nonindicated conventional antipsychotic treatment was associated with clear benefits. Conventional antipsychotics should be used with caution in nonpsychotic depressed patients, particularly in the long term. Reluctance to discontinue medication in more chronic patients may be misplaced."}

A 36-year-old male, who had been healthy, had abdominal pain following high fever. He had marked hypereosinophilia of 17,000/mm3. Radiographs of the chest disclosed a transient infiltrated lesion in the left lower lung. Ultrasonographic and gastroendoscopic examinations revealed acute cholecystitis and duodenitis, respectively. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a filling defect suspecting aberrant ascariasis in the common bile duct. The patient suddenly developed distally dominant mononeuritis multiplex, especially in the upper limbs. Muscle biopsy revealed vasculitis of intramuscular arteries with infiltration of eosinophils. These findings fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of Churg-Strauss syndrome. Corticosteroid dramatically resolved the abdominal symptoms. Cholecystectomy and removal of the foreign body were performed. Histological examinations revealed that necrosis of the gallbladder was caused by occlusion due to thrombosed arteries and that the foreign body in the common bile duct was an aggregate of necrotic epithelium of the bile duct wall surrounded by inflammatory cells. Although abdominal complaints rarely appeared as an initial symptom in the patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome, this syndrome should be taken into consideration for an accurate diagnosis when the patients with abdominal pain of unknown origin had eosinophilia, asthma, or allergic rhinitis."}

Some idiosyncratic drug reactions may occur from episodic decreases in the threshold for drug hepatotoxicity. Previous studies in rats have shown that modest underlying inflammation triggered by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can decrease the threshold for xenobiotic hepatotoxicity. The histamine-2 (H2)-receptor antagonist ranitidine (RAN) causes idiosyncratic reactions in people, with liver as a usual target. We tested the hypothesis that RAN could be rendered hepatotoxic in animals undergoing a modest inflammatory response. Male rats were treated with a nonhepatotoxic dose of LPS (44 x 10(6) endotoxin units/kg i.v.) or its vehicle and then 2 h later with a nonhepatotoxic dose of RAN (30 mg/kg i.v.) or its vehicle. Liver injury was evident only in animals treated with both RAN and LPS as estimated by increases in serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activities within 6 h after RAN administration. LPS/RAN cotreatment resulted in midzonal liver lesions characterized by acute necrosuppurative hepatitis. Famotidine (FAM) is an H2-antagonist for which the propensity for idiosyncratic reactions is far less than RAN. Rats given LPS and FAM at a dose pharmacologically equipotent to that of RAN did not develop liver injury. In vitro, RAN sensitized hepatocytes to killing by cytotoxic products from activated neutrophils, whereas FAM lacked this ability. The results indicate that a response resembling human RAN idiosyncrasy can be reproduced in animals by RAN exposure during modest inflammation."}

The sample of this MRI study consisted of 40 schizophrenic patients, 24 psychiatric and 40 healthy family members from 10 uniaffected and 19 multiple affected families with schizophrenia, such as 27 control subjects from non-affected families. The ventricle-to-brain-ratio (VBR), and the areas of the third ventricle, sylvian fissure, temporal horn and interhemispheric fissure at the slice where these structures reached their maximum were examined relatively to the corresponding total brain areas. The sum of CSF areas was calculated as a parameter for global atrophy. From MANCOVA adjusted for intervening variables the right VBR and the sum of CSF areas revealed significant differences between diagnostic groups. For these areas schizophrenic patients showed an increase compared to control subjects and family members with psychiatric disorder. Genetic loading influenced the interhemispheric fissure, enlarged in multiple affected compared to uniaffected families, and the temporal horn asymmetry, which was right sided (right > left) in control subjects and multiple affected families, but inverted in uniaffected families. Neonatal obstetric complications influenced only the size of the VBR, while premorbid adjustment predicted various CSF areas. In conclusion, schizophrenic subjects from multiple and uniaffected families showed a global atrophy, which was most pronounced in the VBR. Genetic loading seems to have an impact on frontal regions as the interhemispheric fissure and on the temporal horn."}

However, in the majority of the analysed clinical samples, neither of these types of aberrations are found, suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved. The present study shows that COPS3, located in 17p11 and encoding a component of the proteasome pathway, is more frequently amplified in osteosarcomas (OS) than is MDM2. We present detailed analysis of TP53 mutations and MDM2 and COPS3 expression levels in a set of 23 OS. Our results show that none of the tumours with COPS3 amplification had MDM2 amplification nor TP53 mutations, consistent with the hypothesis that one of the three aberrations is sufficient. The results suggest that inactivation of otherwise intact TP53 by aberrations in the proteasome pathway may contribute to the characteristic aneuploidy observed in OS."}
{"pmid": "12778071", "title": "The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor acts as a tumour suppressor in malignant glioma cells.", "abstract": "The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is a membrane glycoprotein with a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain and an extracellular region consisting of two immunoglobulin-like domains, an amino-terminal immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-related domain (D1), which is distal to the cell surface, and a proximal IgC2 domain (D2). The coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor has been shown to exhibit tumour suppression activity in human bladder and prostate cancer cells. In the current paper, we demonstrate that CAR is a tumour suppressor in glioma cells and that the extracellular D2 domain is not required for this inhibitory effect. This finding provides a biological basis for the observation that expression of CAR is downregulated in malignant glioma cells. This suggests that strategies to redirect adenoviruses to achieve CAR-independent infection will be necessary to realise the full potential of adenoviral vectors for cancer gene therapy."}

A controversy has existed for almost two decades, however, concerning the possibility that neutron doses in Hiroshima may have been much larger than estimated. This controversy was based on measurements of radioisotopes activated by thermal neutrons that suggested much higher fluences at larger distances than expected. For fast neutrons, which contributed almost all the neutron dose, clear measurement validation has so far proved impossible at the large distances (900 to 1,500 m) most relevant to survivor locations. Here, the first results are reported for the detection of 63Ni produced predominantly by fast neutrons (above about 1 MeV) in copper samples from Hiroshima. This breakthrough was made possible by the development of chemical extraction methods and major improvements in the sensitivity of accelerator mass spectrometry for detection of 63Ni atoms (refs 8-11). When results are compared with 63Ni activation predicted by neutron doses for Hiroshima survivors, good agreement is observed at the distances most relevant to survivor data. These findings provide, for the first time, clear measurement validation of the neutron doses to survivors in Hiroshima."}

Hepatic iron may promote liver injury, whereas antioxidant vitamins and minerals may inhibit it, but few clinical studies have examined such relationships. We analyzed the associations of serum iron measures and antioxidant concentrations with abnormal serum alanine transaminase (ALT) activity in a large, national, population-based study. A total of 13,605 adult participants in the third U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), 1988-1994, underwent phlebotomy. Exclusions included excessive alcohol consumption, hepatitis B and C, and iron overload. Elevated ALT levels were found in 3.1% of the population. In univariate analysis, factors associated with abnormal ALT levels (P < 0.05) included higher transferrin saturation and iron and selenium concentrations, and lower vitamin C, alpha and beta carotene, and lutein/zeaxanthin concentrations. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, elevated ALT level was associated positively with increasing deciles of transferrin saturation (odds ratio [OR] per decile, 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.18) and iron concentration (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.21). Abnormal ALT level was associated negatively with increasing deciles of alpha carotene (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.94), beta carotene (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.96), beta cryptoxanthin (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99), lutein/zeaxanthin (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96), and a variable combining the 5 carotenoid measures (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95). Vitamin C was associated inversely, but only at the highest concentrations.

Accurate assessment of these important clinical outcomes is integral to effective management of breathlessness of patients with COPD. Twenty consecutive patients with stable moderate-to-severe COPD were tested at 6-week intervals at baseline, after a nonintervention control period (pre-EXT), and after EXT. Patients entered an outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation program involving regular exercise on a bicycle. Incremental symptom-limited exercise testing (1-min increments of 10 W) was performed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer. Oxygen uptake (O(2)), carbon dioxide output (CO(2)), minute ventilation (E), time, and volume components of the respiratory cycle and, in six patients, esophageal pressure swings (Pessw), both as actual values and as percentage of maximal (most negative in sign) esophageal pressure during sniff maneuver (Pessn), were measured continuously over the runs. Exertional dyspnea and leg effort were evaluated by administering a Borg scale. Measurements at baseline and pre-EXT were similar. Significant increase in exercise capacity was found in response to EXT: (1) peak work rate (WR), O(2), CO(2), E, tidal volume (VT), and heart rate increased, while peak exertional dyspnea and leg effort did not significantly change; (2) exertional dyspnea/O(2) and exertional dyspnea/CO(2) decreased while E/O(2) and E/CO(2) remained unchanged. The slope of both exertional dyspnea and leg effort relative to E fell significantly after EXT; (3) at standardized WR, E, and CO(2), exertional dyspnea and leg effort decreased while inspiratory capacity (IC) increased. Decrease in E was accomplished primarily by decrease in respiratory rate (RR) and increase in both inspiratory time (TI) and expiratory time; VT slightly increased, while inspiratory drive (VT/TI) and duty cycle (TI/total time of the respiratory cycle) remained unchanged. The decrease in Pessw and the increase in VT were associated with lower exertional dyspnea after EXT; (4) at standardized E, VT, RR, and IC, Pessw and Pessw(%Pessn)/VT remained unchanged while exertional dyspnea and leg effort decreased with EXT. In conclusion, increases in NMC, aerobic capacity, and tolerance to dyspnogenic stimuli and possibly breathing retraining are likely to contribute to the relief of both exertional dyspnea and leg effort after EXT."}

The present article summarized relevant information of evidences and molecular traces on the origin of actin, tubulin, the chaperonin system for folding them, myosins, kinesins, axonemal dyneins and cytoplasmic dyneins. On this basis the authors proposed a series of works, which should be done in the future, and indicated the ways for reaching the targets. These targets are mainly: 1) the reconstruction of evolutionary path from MreB protein of archaeal ancestor of eukaryotic cells to typical actin; 2) the finding of the MreB or MreB-related proteins in crenarchaea and using them to examine J. A. Lake's hypothesis on the origin of eukaryote from \"eocytes\" (crenarchaea); 3) the examinations of the existence and distribution of cytoskeleton made of MreB-related protein within coccoid archaea, especially in amoeboid archaeon Thermoplasm acidophilum; 4) using Thermoplasma as a model of archaeal ancestor of eukaryotic cells; 5) the searching for the homolog of ancestral dynein in present-day living archaea. During the writing of this article, Margulis' famous spirochaete hypothesis on the origin of flagella and cilia was unexpectedly involved and analyzed from aspects of tubulins, dyneins and spirochaetes. Actually, spirochaete cannot be reasonably assumed as the ectosymbiotic ancestor of eukaryotic flagella and cilia, since their swing depends upon large amount of bacterial flagella beneath the flexible outer wall, but not depends upon their intracellular tubules and the assumed dyneins. In this case, if they had \"evolved\" into cilia and lost their bacterial flagella, they would immediately become immobile! In fact, tubulin and dynein-like proteins have not been found in any spirochaete."}

Part 2: are seizure descriptions discriminative?", "abstract": "To determine whether the seizure descriptions given by a group of neurologists/epileptologists are discriminative. We constructed templates for various seizure types describing how often symptoms were selected by the participants. We defined a matching score to indicate the match between such a template and the symptoms selected by each neurologist/epileptologist individually and computed the scores for each of the sets of selected symptoms with all templates. Correlation coefficients were calculated between the templates. Data were collected from 24 participants. The matching scores and the correlation coefficients both show that participants provide discriminative descriptions of the seizure types. Descriptions of aggregated seizure types, such as primary generalized seizures, are less discriminatory than the descriptions of more specific seizure types. We concluded that the participants in our study selected symptoms that result in discriminative descriptions of the seizure types. This indicates that knowledge elicitation by using the opinions of a group of clinical experts is possible. The study also indicates that the design of the study could be ameliorated in several ways. These findings will be taken into account when designing the final study."}

Deaths from ischemic stroke may rise unless future declines in stroke death rates offset the projected growth in high-risk populations. Using data on ischemic stroke mortality from the National Center of Health Statistics for 1979 to 1998, we fit a logistic model to predict changes in stroke death rates as a function of time for each of 42 sex-race-age groups. Using population projections from the US Census Bureau, we then calculated the expected number of deaths in the United States from ischemic stroke over the next 30 years on the basis of age, sex, and race. Models generally fit historical data well (median R2=0.81; interquartile range, 0.43 to 0.97) and consistently predicted small declines in future death rates. The total predicted number of stroke deaths increased by 98% from 139,000 in 2002 to 275,000 in 2032, whereas the total US population was projected to increase by only 27% in the same period. The largest percentage increases in stroke deaths were predicted to occur in blacks (134%) and nonwhite, nonblack races (221%). If recent trends in ischemic stroke mortality continue, increases in US stroke deaths will outpace overall population growth, with a doubling in deaths over the next 30 years."}

It was also investigated whether, apart from CSA, MVA and MRR were determinants of muscle strength. Polio subjects had significantly less strength, CSA, and MRR in the more-affected quadriceps than control subjects. MVA was reduced in 18 polio subjects and normal in all controls. PPS subjects differed from non-PPS subjects only in that the MVA of the more-affected quadriceps was significantly lower. Both CSA and MVA were found to be associated with muscle strength. Quadriceps strength in polio subjects was dependent not only on muscle mass, but also on the ability to activate the muscles. Since impaired activation was more pronounced in PPS subjects, the new muscle weakness and functional decline in PPS may be due not only to a gradual loss of muscle fibers, but also to an increasing inability to activate the muscles."}

A variety of frozen pre-cooked foods and an assortment of nutmeats were examined after primary incubation in Lauryl Sulfate Tryptose (LST) broth. In 85.3% of the cases, the parallel tubes of EC broth incubated for 24 hr at 44.5 and 45.5 C gave rise to identical E. coli responses of positive, false positive, and negative. The remaining 14.7% of the reactions represent the qualitative difference between the two temperatures. The EC test at 45.5 C was more specific for E. coli, since two- to threefold fewer false positives were produced at this temperature than at 44.5 C. However, fecal E. coli recoveries were slightly higher (4%) at the lower temperature. Incubating the EC tubes from the interval of 24 to 48 hr gave rise to an additional 4.3% of E. coli recovery, but this was accompanied by an excessive production of false positives (75.9%), representing a 3.5-fold decrease in specificity. It is recommended that, in the confirmatory use of EC broth in the examination of frozen foods and nutmeats for the recovery of fecal E. coli, the test be made at 45.5 C in a water bath and limited to 24 hr of incubation only, to insure optimal specificity. During the study, a \"fixed\" productivity ratio was noted; E. coli(+)/LST(+) equaled approximately one-fourth or 25%. The significance of this ratio is discussed."}

This study aimed to ascertain whether a 5-item intimate partner violence screening questionnaire could be used effectively in the ED with low-income black women to accurately predict partner abuse status. Data were collected from 200 black women who answered in the affirmative to at least 1 item on the intimate partner violence screener questionnaire, the Universal Violence Prevention Screening Protocol. The women completed a comprehensive battery of measures, including the Index of Spouse Abuse, a commonly used and psychometrically sound measure of intimate partner violence. Bivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that, compared with women below the physical-intimate partner violence cut point on the Index of Spouse Abuse, women above the cut point on physical-intimate partner violence on the Index of Spouse Abuse were more likely to answer yes to Universal Violence Prevention Screening Protocol screening questions related to physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; threats to be harmed physically; and being afraid. Compared with women below the nonphysical-intimate partner violence cut point on the Index of Spouse Abuse, women above the cut point on nonphysical intimate partner violence on the Index of Spouse Abuse were more likely to answer yes to each screening question on the Universal Violence Prevention Screening Protocol. The 2 Universal Violence Prevention Screening Protocol screening items related to physical abuse best predicted the 2 Index of Spouse Abuse scales. Accurate prediction of physical and nonphysical abuse on the Index of Spouse Abuse required affirmative responses to 4 or more screening questions on the Universal Violence Prevention Screening Protocol. A brief intimate partner violence screening device in the emergency care setting can identify abused, low-income, black women. The study is limited by the fact that universal screening was not conducted, the inclusion of only women who acknowledged some form of intimate partner violence, a reliance on retrospective self-reports, and the questionable generalizability of the findings to groups other than low-income black women."}

With a susceptibility testing breakpoint of < or = 1 mg/L for both compounds, 96.1% of isolates were susceptible to telithromycin and 99.8% to cethromycin. Erythromycin non-susceptible isolates (intermediate plus resistant, MIC > or = 0.5 mg/L) comprised 23% of those tested, and were analysed for the genetic basis of their resistance by PCR. Among these isolates (n = 95), 72.6% harboured mef(A), 8.4%, erm(B), and 3.2%, erm(A), as sole macrolide resistance gene, whereas the presence of mef(A) plus erm(A) (11.6%) or mef(A) plus erm(B) (4.2%) was also observed. Both ketolides displayed a significant in vitro activity against S. pyogenes regardless of the macrolide resistance mechanisms. Nevertheless, in the case of telithromycin, 11 out of 19 of the erm(B)-positive isolates (2.7% of total population) exhibited an MIC range of 4-32 mg/L.

Use of salicylates and/or antibiotics can be effective in mild to moderate disease, while steroids are the accepted therapy for more severe active disease. Azathioprine and other immunosuppresant drugs can be used as adjunctive therapy for active Crohn's disease and may help to maintain remission.

Elevated levels of QA and PA in CSF were associated with a fatal outcome in Malawian children with cerebral malaria (CM). QA was associated with a history of convulsions. An increase in the QArcolon;KA ratio, which favors neurotoxicity, was observed only in the 3 patients with tuberculosis meningitis.

Here we demonstrate that a functional, soluble form of the HTLV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein, gp46, fused to an immunoglobulin Fc region (gp46-Fc) binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on mammalian cells. Substantial binding of gp46-Fc to HeLa and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells that express HSPGs was detected, whereas binding to the sister CHO lines 2244, which expresses no HSPGs, and 2241, which expresses no glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), was much reduced. Enzymatic removal of HSPGs from HeLa and CHO K1 cells also reduced gp46-Fc binding. Dextran sulfate inhibited gp46-Fc binding to HSPG-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas chondroitin sulfate was less effective. By contrast, dextran sulfate inhibited gp46-Fc binding to GAG-negative cells such as CHO 2244, CHO 2241, and Jurkat T cells weakly or not at all. Dextran sulfate inhibited HTLV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env)-pseudotyped virus infection of permissive, HSPG-expressing target cells and blocked syncytium formation between HTLV-1 Env-expressing cells and HSPG-expressing permissive target cells. Finally, HSPG-expressing cells were more permissive for HTLV-1 Env-pseudotyped virus infection than HSPG-negative cells. Thus, similar to other pathogenic viruses, HTLV-1 may have evolved to use HSPGs as cellular attachment receptors to facilitate its propagation."}

The first step of the synthesis involves the covalent modification of 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane with an organic fluorophore, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, under N2 atmosphere for getting a fluorescent silica precursor. Then the NFHS particles, with a diameter of well below 40 nm, were prepared by controlled hydrolysis of the fluorescent silica precursor with tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) using the reverse micelle technique. The fluorophores are dispersed homogeneously in the silica network of the NFHS particles and well protected from the environmental oxygen. Furthermore, since the fluorophores are covalently bound to the silica network, there is no migration, aggregation and leakage of the fluorophores. In comparison with common single organic fluorophores, these particle probes are brighter, more stable against photobleaching and do not suffer from intermittent on/off light emission (blinking). We have used these newly developed NFHS particles as a fluorescent marker to label antibodies, using silica immobilization method, for the immunoassay of human alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The detection limit of this method was down to 0.05 ng mL(-1) under our current experimental conditions. We think this material would attract much attention and be applied widely in biotechnology."}

This is because when testing large field losses, the standard automated or manual visual field testing systems have limited fixation controls. Measured visual field recovery in these cases may not be real but instead may be due to an artifact such as scanning eye movement. This article illustrates a way to separate the actual visual field sparing from scanning eye movement artifact by using perimetry testing with the scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). During the SLO perimetry, the examiner has a direct and magnified view of the retinal fixation locus. This direct view allows for the added ability to monitor the fixation stability during target presentation. When eye movements larger than 1 degrees are noted, the examiner can repeat the trial. During static perimetry, our SLO records the retinal position of the fixation target at the end of the stimulus presentation and corrects scanning eye movements that occur during stimulus presentation. These special features enable us to identify when the apparent sparing of the visual field is due to the artifact of scanning. To demonstrate this, we selected the records of four hemianopic patients whose fields were examined by both standard perimetry and the SLO. We then compared the clinical visual fields with the SLO perimetry fields. One of the patients had a complete homonymous hemianopia on both the clinical perimetry and the SLO perimetry. A second patient was found by the SLO to have unstable fixation during testing. The SLO perimetry revealed that the apparent spared fields seen in standard perimetry were the result of eye scanning and not an actual enlargement of the visual field. Two other patients were confirmed by the SLO findings to have valid partial recovery of the visual field, one with and one without scanning eye movements. The advantages and limitations of SLO perimetry in analyzing hemianopic field sparing are discussed."}

After the reconfirmation of the diagnosis of periodic paralysis by an exercise test, oral acetazolamide (750 mg/day) was started. In subsequent exercise test, the increment of the CMAP amplitude of abductor digiti minimi during exercise became smaller and the decrement of CMAP amplitude after exercise disappeared thereafter, which was assumed to be related with clinical improvement. The noninvasive exercise test is useful not only to diagnose periodic paralysis but also to evaluate therapeutic efficacy."}

Its role in the aetiology of primary biliary cirrhosis is controversial. Two cases of neonatal hepatitis seropositive for anti-mitochondrial antibody are described. Anti-mitochondrial antibody Ig isotype and epitopic specificity were investigated by immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassays. In both infants anti-mitochondrial antibody was of the G class, mainly G1 and G3 subclasses, and reacted with two synthetic peptides reproducing major M2 epitopicregions: innerlipoyl domain pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC)-E2(162-176) and PDC-E3 binding protein (PDC-E3BP)86-100. One infant also reacted with outer lipoyl domain PDC-E2(35-49), and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC)-E2(99-113). An identical pattern of reactivity was present in their mothers, indicating the maternal origin of the antibodies. Anti-mitochondrial antibody disappeared in the infants with the disappearance of the liver pathology. The simultaneous disappearance of hepatitis and anti-mitochondrial antibody in the infants suggests a possible causal link between the two."}

CYP2E1 is induced by alcohol and cigarette smoking and may contribute to metabolic tolerance in alcoholics. The CYP2E1*1D polymorphism has been associated with greater CYP2E1 inducibility. One objective was to determine the frequency of the variant allele in eight ethnic groups. Further, the Canadian Native Indian, South-east Asian Canadian and Caucasian Canadian groups were stratified by alcohol and nicotine dependence (as measured by DSM-IV criteria) to examine the potential association of CYP2E1*1D with drug dependence. We found a significantly greater frequency of the CYP2E1*1D allele among Indo-Asian Canadians (0.31), Chinese Canadians (0.19), Taiwanese (0.20), Japanese Canadians (0.18), African Americans (0.13), African Canadians (0.10) and Canadian Native Indians (0.09) compared to Caucasian Canadians (0.02). Although the power of the association study was low among some subgroups, the CYP2E1*1D genotype (subjects with at least one variant allele) was associated with alcohol as well as nicotine dependence. Specifically, Canadian Native Indians dependent on nicotine alone or alcohol alone exhibited significantly greater CYP2E1*1D frequencies compared to non-drug dependent controls, while the variant frequency among Southeast Asians dependent on nicotine was greater than their non-drug dependent counterparts. We also found that CYP2E1*1D genotype was associated with significantly greater 3-hydroxycotinine per cigarette in African Americans. The variable frequency of CYP2E1*1D among ethnic groups suggests a greater risk for diseases putatively related to CYP2E1 in some non-Caucasian ethnic groups. The association of CYP2E1*1D with alcohol and nicotine dependence suggests that CYP2E1 may contribute to the development of these dependencies."}

Better understanding of the cellular basis underlying the DTH reaction is required if diagnostic methods are to be improved upon. Previous studies have shown that gamma delta T-cells, particularly those bearing the WC1 molecule, are present at an early stage of developing DTH responses and that such cells may modulate the developing immune response immediately following M. bovis-infection. However, their role, if any, in the DTH response remains unclear. In the present study we have used an in vivo model to deplete WC1(+) gamma delta T-cells, from cattle with established M. bovis-infection, prior to skin-testing. Results indicate that, although WC1(+) gamma delta T-cells do infiltrate the skin-test site in normal calves, they do not appear to be essential for the development of DTH skin swelling, as indicated by effective development of skin responses in calves depleted of circulating WC1(+) gamma delta T-cells."}

Twenty-five patients with MG were assessed to compare the sensitivity of RNS of the nasalis muscle to that of the hypothenar muscles. Abnormal decrement was found in hypothenar muscles in 9 patients (36%) and in the nasalis muscle in 13 patients (52%). RNS of the nasalis muscle appeared more useful to detect abnormal neuromuscular transmission in patients with oculobulbar MG (5 of 5) than hypothenar RNS (1 of 5). In patients with generalized MG, hypothenar muscles had a similar yield of abnormal RNS tests."}

The essay comparatively analyses the epistemologies of medical knowledge and practice that inspired the main educational reforms of the XXth century, namely the so called Flexner Reform at the beginning of the century and the more recent introduction of the problem based teaching. The hypothesis that some difficulties in the face of medical pedagogy are due to a kind of epistemological dissonance of today medicine is advanced. In a sense, teaching medical humanities could promote such dissonance. Moreover, when we look at the history of medical education and take into consideration the epistemological and the practical demands that drove the two most important reforms of medical pedagogy it seems apparent that they corresponded to quite definite ideas about the status and aims of medicine. The conceptual and practical challenges emerging with the genomic transformation of medicine can represent the opportunity to redefine on a more coherent basis the theoretical and methodological foundations of medical knowledge and practice. The pedagogical implications of the new epistemological perspective of genomic medicine will be examined."}

We studied 16 control subjects and 51 stroke patients. fMRI was performed at 1.5 T using a finger flexion-extension movement paradigm. The incidence of bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex activation was significantly increased during movements of the affected hand of stroke patients who showed mirror movements. Moreover, the incidence of bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex activation increased with the severity of mirror movements and primary sensorimotor cortex was activated bilaterally in all patients who showed sustained mirror movements. We conclude that the motor cortex activation on the non-stroke side is associated with mirror movements and is correlated with the severity of mirror movements. It seems that the pathophysiological mechanism of sustained mirror movements in stroke patients involves the unaffected motor cortex."}

It is essential to understand the anatomy of the pelvic muscle (striated muscle complex: SMC) including the external anal sphincter and their three-dimensional (3D) configuration in each patient. Thus, we studied the SMC three-dimensionally with multidetector-row helical computed tomography (MRH-CT) preoperatively, and evaluated its usefulness. Fourteen patients with anorectal malformations before anorectoplasty (types: high n=6, intermediate n=2, low n=6) and two patients without anorectal malformations as controls (total: male n=8, female n=8) were investigated. An image of pelvic region was prepared with a slice thickness of 0.5 mm and a reconstruction pitch of 0.5 mm. A 3D reconstruction on a conventional personal computer (PC) was made with a volume rendering method, and assisted by our own software. The SMC was analyzed with three modified modes of 3D reconstruction corresponding to the surrounding tissues. A length of the parasagittal muscle, and both the sagittal and transverse width of the vertical fibers in the SMC at the connection to the parasagittal muscle were measured on a 3D image and then compared among three different types and controls. To eliminate variations in age, a length index was used to allow comparison. The 3D configuration of the SMC was different in every case. The arranged image mode, which displayed the SMC and the pelvic bones simultaneously, enabled to use conventional knowledge in cysto-urethrography. The length of the parasagittal muscle was longest in the high type but the width of the vertical fibers was smallest. Anatomical figures of the SMC including the external anal sphincter were clearly demonstrated on a PC in every anorectal malformation by our program. A 3D reconstruction image provides positional information on the SMC for the body surface and pelvic bone at the same time. Both a 3D image and positional information with MRH-CT offers the surgeon a simulated operative profile of the SMC superior to CT or magnetic resonance imaging slices alone."}

Detailed descriptions of germ cell migration in Drosophila were accomplished long ago, but most genetic and molecular analyses of the process have occurred within the past 10 years. A few of the genes required for germ cell migration have been identified, and a very interesting picture is emerging. However, a process as complex as cell migration must involve the functions of many more molecules. In addition, cell migration and cell death mechanisms are often linked, as it is important to eliminate cells that are misplaced and could present a danger to the organism. In Drosophila, genes involved in germ cell migration can also affect programmed cell death. Currently, very little is known about how germ cells ectopic to the gonads are eliminated. To date, only four genes have been reported with roles in germ cell death, and three of these have additional functions in germ cell pathfinding. The nature of the cell death program has not been elucidated. Here, I provide a brief review of Drosophila germ cell migration and programmed cell death at both the descriptive and molecular levels. Many questions remain to be answered, but advances made in recent years are providing useful insights into these critical biological phenomena."}

In the first part devoted to Pha identification the data of conformational analysis and electronic structure calculation of each of the molecules in the training set are used to construct EC matrices of congruity (ECMC) that include atomic interaction indices as diagonal elements, and bond orders and interatomic distances as off-diagonal elements. Multiple comparisons of the ECMC's of the active compounds between themselves and with those of inactive compounds allows one to separate a relatively small number of matrix elements that within certain tolerances are common to all the ECMC's of the active compounds, while not present in the same combination in the inactive compounds. This is the EC submatrix of activity that represent the Pha, while the tolerances characterize the Pha flexibilities. Distinguished from QSAR approaches, the Pha is obtained here by computational (non-statistical) methods only. The second part of the problem, quantitative activity prediction, is based on using the Pha flexibilities together with the anti-Pha shielding and other auxiliary groups influence in a parameterization and regression analysis procedure that allows for quantitative prediction. An original approach is suggested that side steps the multi-conformational implications. This post-Pha problem is similar to a QSAR approach with special physically transparent descriptors that allow one to avoid chance correlations in the regression procedure. Illustration of the method is given for several drug design problems in which, where sufficiently accurate experimental data are available, the identification of the Pha as a necessary condition of activity is almost 100% correct, while quantitative activity prediction is near to the accuracy of the experimental data, 80% - 90%."}

Two isolates from meat and two clinical isolates related to food-borne listeriosis, in which the implicated food product had about 2-3.5% (w/v) sodium chloride, also were studied. The effect of temperature on pH and sodium chloride sensitivity was also determined. The results show that natural isolates vary in response to these stresses and the data were often at variance with previously published data. Strains varied in sensitivity to low pH and to high sodium chloride concentration but the cheese isolates tended to be more resistant. A lower temperature was associated with a decrease in resistance to low pH and to sodium chloride. All strains showed an acid tolerance response induction when grown at pH 5.5 and although the time required for maximum induction of the response varied between strains, 2 h of acid adaptation, at least, was necessary which is longer than previously reported. Some strains showed an osmotolerance response after incubation in 3.5% (w/v) sodium chloride. Osmoadaptation, in addition to inducing an osmotolerance response, also induced cross-protection against acid shock conditions (pH 3.5). The acid tolerance response also induced a cross-protection against osmotic shock conditions (20% (w/v) sodium chloride). In some cases there was a relationship between the degree of resistance and adaptation, but usually the behaviour of a particular strain was independent of the conditions from which it was isolated."}

We measured plasma tCys in blood samples from 12,595 men and women 40-42 years of age and from 4766 men and women 65-67 years of age, collected as part of the Hordaland Homocysteine Study in the year 1992-1993. Follow-up data on mortality were collected through 1999. Data on CVD hospitalizations were collected from hospital records up to May 31, 1998. After a follow-up time of 6.6-7.6 years, there were a total of 610 deaths, of which 243 were cardiovascular deaths and 367 were noncardiovascular deaths. There was no association between tCys and all-cause, cardiovascular, or noncardiovascular mortality. When we used tCys values <247.6 micromol/L (lowest quartile) as the reference category, the adjusted mortality ratio (MR) for all-cause mortality at tCys concentrations of 247.6-270.79, 270.8-295.79, and > or =295.8 micromol/L (highest quartile) were 1.0, 0.9, and 1.0, respectively. The adjusted MRs for cardiovascular mortality were 1.0, 1.1, and 1.1, respectively. There were no associations between tCys and 1275 CVD hospitalizations, except that tCys was significantly associated with hospitalizations from coronary artery bypass grafting.

Previous studies have suggested that symptom screening instruments may be useful in predicting risk of longer-term psychiatric morbidity, but results have varied. The present study is based on 83 of an eligible 102 consecutive hospital-admitted survivors of road trauma who completed a structured clinical interview at baseline and 18-month follow-up. A subsample returned symptom questionnaires within 2 weeks of the accident, with between 60 and 66 completing the questionnaire. Receiver Operator Characteristic curve analyses were applied to obtain optimal predictive scores on each screening measure. Combining the derived cutoff scores on the Impact of Event Scale (measuring posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms) and the Beck Depression Inventory yielded an odds ratio of 82.9 in predicting any psychiatric morbidity at 18 months, with a specificity of 95%, and high positive (89%) and negative (91%) predictive indices. If these exploratory findings are confirmed by future studies, the case will be strengthened for routine screening of motor vehicle accident survivors to allow ongoing monitoring and selective early interventions for the high-risk subgroup. Compliance with completing and returning questionnaires remains a major challenge in this population, however, as indicated by the level of attrition in our study."}

The effect of potential ECE inhibitors was determined in vitro by measurement of isometric contractions, induced by big ET-1, in isolated rat basilar arteries. Intact and de-endothelialized endothelium (E+ and E-, respectively) segments were examined after preincubation with the putative ECE inhibitors: phosphoramidon (10(-4) M), and [22D-Val]big ET-1 [16-38] (10(-5) M and 10(-6) M). Additionally, the effect of [D-Val22]big ET-1 [16-38] was investigated in rabbits after intracisternal application in order to inhibit the contraction of the basilar artery induced by (2x10(-6) M) big ET-1. Application of 10(-4)-M phosphoramidon resulted in a statistically significant decrease in big ET-1-induced contraction in E+ and E- segments; 10(-5)-M and 10(-6)-M [22D-Val]big ET-1 [16-38] in E- segments produced no statistically significant effect. The application of 10(-6)-M [22D-Val]big ET-1 [16-38] in E+ segments caused increased contractions, as shown by the shift to the left of the concentration-effect curve (CEC). In the rabbit group pretreated with [D-Val22]big ET-1 [16-38] (2x10(-5) M) (n=8), the angiographically measured diameter of the basilar artery increased from 0.63+/-0.12 mm to 0.66+/-0.12 mm. In the control group (n=8), this diameter decreased from 0.71+/-0.13 mm to 0.57+/-0.15 mm. This corresponded to an increase in vessel diameter of 5.24+/-9.89% in the treatment group and a decrease of 19.54+/-15.81% in the control group (P=0.002). The present study indicates the existence of functional ECE activity in rat basilar artery, which differs in the endothelium and the smooth muscle layer. These results demonstrate that [D-Val22]big ET-1 [16-38] has a potent ECE-inhibitory effect, preventing cerebral vasospasm in rabbit basilar artery by inhibiting the transformation of big ET-1 to vasoactive ET-1 after intracisternal application in vivo, whereas no inhibitory effect was detectable in rat basilar artery in vitro. Therefore, further studies of the biochemical nature of cerebrovascular ECE activity are required."}

{"pmid": "12965094", "title": "The effects of maternal exercise on fetal oxygenation and feto-placental growth.", "abstract": "Sustained bouts of maternal exercise during pregnancy cause an acute reduction in oxygen and nutrient delivery to the placental site. The decreased flow also initiates a slight fall in intervillous and fetal pO2 which initiates a fetal sympathetic response. This, coupled with hemoconcentration and improved placental perfusion balance, maintains fetal tissue perfusion and oxygen uptake. Exercise training during pregnancy (regular bouts of sustained exercise) increases resting maternal (and perhaps fetal) plasma volume, intervillous space blood volume, cardiac output and placental function. These changes buffer the acute reductions in oxygen and nutrient delivery during exercise and probably increase 24 h nutrient delivery to the placental site. Thus, the effect of any given exercise regimen on fetal growth and size at birth is dependent on the type, frequency, intensity and duration of the exercise as well as the time point in the pregnancy when the exercise is performed. Maternal carbohydrate intake is yet another modifying factor. Beginning a moderate exercise regimen increases both anatomic markers of placental function and size at birth while maintaining a rigorous exercise regimen throughout pregnancy selectively reduces growth of the fetal fat organ and size at birth. Likewise, decreasing exercise performance in late-pregnancy increases size at birth while increasing exercise performance decreases it. Finally, the infants born of exercising women who eat carbohydrates which elevate 24 h blood glucose levels are large at birth irrespective of exercise performance."}

Questionnaires were distributed to the mothers in the Maternity Department at Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot. The questionnaires included demographic data and questions relating to their current desire to breastfeed and their previous breastfeeding experience. The women were contacted by phone after 4-6 months and the actual breastfeeding history was noted. Women who were still breastfeeding at that time were contacted again 12-15 months after delivery. During the study period, there were 733 births in the hospital. Approximately 600 questionnaires were distributed and 515 (86%) women responded. Four hundred and seventy (91%) of the mothers were contacted by phone 4-6 months after delivery. The results showed that 87% of the women started breastfeeding, while 51% breastfed their babies for at least 3 months, 25% for at least 6 months and 8% breastfed their babies for one year. Women born in Ethiopia breastfed their babies for significantly longer periods than women of any other origin. Women who defined themselves as ultra orthodox, breastfed their babies significantly longer then women who defined themselves as religious, traditional or secular. The study revealed that 70% of the women did not receive any assistance with breastfeeding outside the hospital and 42% of the women stop breastfeeding because of \"insufficient milk\". The rate of initiation of breastfeeding is high among Israeli women in our survey. Breastfeeding duration is higher today than in previous reports for Israeli women in the 1970's and 1980's. Women who were born in Ethiopia breastfed their child for a longer duration than women who were born elsewhere. Women who defined themselves as ultra orthodox breastfed longer then women who defined themselves in any other way. The most common reason to stop breastfeeding is \"insufficient milk\", which in most cases is a reversible condition."}

These procedures are usually carried out with orthodontic control of the dentition to produce the best results. These same procedures can be used on the edentulous patient to correct the discrepancies between the jaws in order to reconstruct the dentition with implants. Bone grafting procedures are often required for these procedures so that the alveolus can be augmented at the same time and allow for dental implants to be placed at a later date."}

The respiratory impedance was measured by using IOS technique and polysomnography (PSG) was monitored synchronously in 36 OSAS patients, 14 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 12 normal controls. Results showed that R20 in OSAS group was significantly higher than in COPD group and control group (P < 0.01). R5-R20 in OSAS group was lower than that in COPD group, but significantly higher than that in control group (P < 0.01). The levels of R20 and R5-R20 were positively correlated with severity degree of the disease. In addition, apnea-hyponea index (AHI) was positively correlated with R5 and R20 with the correlation index (r)being 0.66 and 0.86 respectively. The lowest SO2 was negatively correlated with R5 and R5-R20, with r being -0.66 and -0.79 respectively. The mean SO2 was negatively correlated with R5 and R5-R20 with r being -0.81 and -0.69 respectively. IOS technique could be used as a valuable tool for assessing the degree of upper airway obstruction in the patients with OSAS, and could help to explore its pathological mechanism."}

Little attention has been given to analyses of molecular phylogenetic relationships among Bactrocera subgenera. By using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) sequences, the phylogenetic relationships among four subgenera, Asiadacus, Bactrocera, Hemigymnodacus, and Zeugodacus, were investigated. Nucleotide diversity within subgenera ranged from 11.7 to 12.4%, and the net divergence among subgenera ranged from 11.2 to 15.7%. Phylogenetic trees calculated from both maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis methods were highly congruent in terms of tree topologies. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial COI sequences suggests that tephritid fruit fly species, which attack cucurbit plants, that is, Asiadacus, Hemigymnodacus and Zeugodacus, were more closely related to each other than to fruit fly species of the subgenus Bactrocera, which attack plants of numerous families. Our data supports previous classification of Bactrocera based on morphological characters. However, the phylogenetic tree showed the polyphyletic of fruit flies in subgenus Zeugodacus. Possible causes of speciation among fruit flies species in this genus were also discussed."}

Thus, patterns of epigenetic DNA modification were investigated in the 5'-regulatory region of the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) in two pairs of monozygotic twins, one concordant and one discordant for schizophrenia. The bisulfite DNA modification-based approach was used to fine-map methylated cytosines in DRD2 in genomic DNA extracted from lymphocytes. Numerous DNA methylation differences were identified in the analyzed region both within and between the pairs of MZ twins. \"Epigenetic distances\" between MZ twins were calculated and used for the comparison of twin DRD2 methylation profiles. It was detected that the affected twin from the pair discordant for schizophrenia was epigenetically \"closer\" to the affected concordant twins than to his unaffected MZ co-twin. Although the epigenetic analysis was conducted for only several hundred base pairs of DRD2, the fact that numerous studies identified nonuniform methylation patterns across the clones of bisulfite-modified DNA from the same individual, as well as nonuniform patterns across different individuals, argues for the universality of intra- and interindividual epigenetic variation. Epigenetic studies should provide insight into the molecular causes of differential susceptibility to a disease in genetically identical organisms that may generalize to singletons."}

Numerous vasopressin antagonists are currently under development for the treatment of this syndrome. Preclinical and clinical data describing the effects of vasopressin and the vasopressin antagonists on both normal physiology and heart failure were reviewed. Through activation of V(1a) and V(2) receptors, vasopressin regulates various physiological processes including body fluid regulation, vascular tone regulation, and cardiovascular contractility. Vasopressin synthesis is significantly and chronically elevated in patients with heart failure despite the volume overload and reductions in plasma osmolality often observed in these patients. Vasopressin also appears to adversely effect hemodynamics and cardiac remodeling, while potentiating the effects of norepinephrine and angiotensin II. The selective V(2) and dual V(1a)/V(2) receptor antagonists tolvaptan and conivaptan, respectively, substantially increase free water excretion and plasma osmolality, reduce body weight, improve symptoms of congestion, and moderately increase serum sodium concentrations in patients with heart failure who present with symptoms of fluid overload. Tolvaptan effectively normalizes serum sodium concentrations in hyponatremic heart failure patients. Conivaptan significantly reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure without affecting systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output. The clinical significance of V(1a) receptor antagonism requires further investigation. Current preclinical and clinical findings with the vasopressin antagonists appear promising, however further evaluation in phase III clinical trials is necessary to define the role of vasopressin antagonism in the treatment of heart failure."}

The system was 15 m3 in volume. It contained 45 L of algal suspension with a dry substance density of 10-12 g per liter; water volume, including the algal suspension, was 59 L. More sophisticated model systems with partial substitution of unicellular algae with higher plates (crop area of 15 m2) were tested in three experiments from 1.5 to 2 months in duration. The experiments demonstrated that LSS employing the unicellular algae play not only a macrofunction (regeneration of atmosphere and water) but also carry some other functions (purification of atmosphere, formation of microbial cenosis etc.) providing an adequate human environment. It is also important that functional reliability of the algal regenerative subsystem is secured by a huge number of cells able, in the event of death of a part of population, to recover in the shortest possible time the size of population and, hence, functionality of the LSS autotrophic component. For a long period of time a Martian crew will be detached from Earth's biosphere and for this reason LSS of their vehicle must be highly reliable, robust and redundant. One of the approaches to LSS redundancy is installation of two systems with different but equally efficient regeneration technologies, i.e. physical-chemical and biological. At best, these two systems should operate in parallel sharing the function of regeneration of the human environment. In case of failure or a sharp deterioration in performance of one system the other will, by way of redundancy, increase its throughput to make up for the loss. This LSS design will enable simultaneous handling of a number of critical problems including adequate satisfaction of human environmental needs."}

Spätzle is synthesized as a pro-protein and is processed to a functional form by a serine protease. We show here that the mature form of Spätzle triggers a Toll-dependent immune response after injection into the hemolymph of flies. Spätzle specifically bound to Drosophila cells and to Cos-7 cells expressing Toll. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that the mature form of Spätzle bound to the Toll ectodomain with high affinity and with a stoichiometry of one Spätzle dimer to two receptors. The Spätzle pro-protein was inactive in all these assays, indicating that the pro-domain sequence, which is natively unstructured, acts to prevent interaction of the cytokine and its receptor Toll. These results show that, in contrast to the human Toll-like receptors, Drosophila Toll requires only an endogenous protein ligand for activation and signaling."}

A questionnaire survey. A questionnaire was completed by 273 athletes (91% completion rate) who participated in the National Sports festival in May 2002 in Benin City, Nigeria. The sample was representative of all the 36 states in Nigeria including the Federal capital territory, Abuja. Descriptive statistics were employed and the data were further analysed using the chi-square test. Awareness concerning mouthguards was claimed by 226 (82.8%) of the athletes but significantly fewer athletes who claimed awareness of the devices were using them. Only 93 (41.2%) of this mouthguard-aware group knew of the three types of mouthguard available. Of all the respondents, 131 (48.0%) believed that wearing mouthguards would reduce the prevalence and/or severity of oro-facial injuries during sports. In all, 158 (57.9%) of them had one form of oro-facial injury or the other with contact sports accounting for most of them (78.5%) while 21.5% resulted from non-contact events. The prevalence of oro-facial injuries was significantly lower while wearing mouth protectors. Although the majority of the athletes claimed awareness of mouthguards, less than one-third used them. Over half of the athletes were not sure that mouthguards could reduce the prevalence and/or severity of oro-facial injuries. There is need to educate the athletes more concerning mouthguards."}

In 2001, 419 different isolates of S. pyogenes, including 275 from respiratory secretions, 87 from wound pus, and 31 from blood, were collected from nine hospitals in different parts of Taiwan. MICs of 23 antimicrobial agents were determined at a central location by the agar dilution method. All of the isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC(90)], <or=0.03 microg/ml), cefotaxime (MIC(90), <or=0.03 microg/ml), cefepime (MIC(90), 0.06 microg/ml), meropenem (MIC(90), <or=0.03 microg/ml), moxifloxacin (MIC(90), 0.25 microg/ml), vancomycin (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml), and linezolid (MIC(90), 1 micro g/ml). Overall, 78% of isolates were not susceptible to erythromycin (54% were intermediate, and 24% were resistant), and 5% were not susceptible to clindamycin. Of the 101 erythromycin-resistant isolates, 80.2% exhibited the M phenotype (mefA gene positive), 18.9% exhibited the cMLS (constitutive resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B [MLS]) phenotype (ermB gene positive), and 1% exhibited the iMLS (inducible resistance to MLS) phenotype (ermB gene positive). Fluoroquinolones (sitafloxacin > moxifloxacin > ciprofloxacin = levofloxacin = gatifloxacin > gemifloxacin) demonstrated potent activity against nearly all of the isolates of S. pyogenes tested. Thirty-two isolates (8%) were not susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. Seventeen percent of isolates had telithromycin MICs of >or=1 microg/ml, and all of these isolates exhibited erythromycin MICs of >or=32 microg/ml. The high prevalence of resistance to telithromycin (which is not available in Taiwan) limits its potential use in the treatment of S. pyogenes infections, particularly in areas with high rates of macrolide resistance."}

On 3 separate occasions, 18 adults ingested 25 000 IU vitamin D(2) in 240 mL whole milk or skim milk or in 0.1 mL corn oil applied to toast. A separate, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial investigated whether the consumption of orange juice fortified with vitamin D(3) would increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations: 14 subjects ingested 240 mL orange juice fortified with 1000 IU vitamin D, and 12 subjects ingested a control orange juice daily for 12 wk. Peak serum vitamin D(2) concentrations did not differ significantly after the ingestion of vitamin D(2) in whole milk, skim milk, or corn oil on toast. After subjects consumed orange juice fortified with 1000 IU vitamin D(3) daily for 12 wk, serum 25(OH)D(3) concentrations increased by 150%, and serum parathyroid hormone concentrations decreased by 25% compared with baseline; control subjects had a seasonal increase of 45% in 25(OH)D and no significant change in serum parathyroid hormone.

Autosomal dominant PEO is caused by mutations in at least 3 genes: adenine nucleotide translocator-1 (ANT1), encoding the muscle-specific adenine nucleotide translocator; chromosome 10 open reading frame 2 (C10orf2), encoding Twinkle helicase; and polymerase gamma (POLG), encoding the alpha subunit of polymerase gamma. Mutations in POLG can also cause autosomal recessive PEO, which is often associated with multisystemic disorders. To further investigate the frequency and genotype-phenotype correlations of mutations in the POLG gene, we used single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing to screen 30 patients with familial or sporadic PEO and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in muscle but without mutations in ANT1 and C10orf2. Four unrelated patients had novel POLG mutations. A woman with PEO and mental retardation had a heterozygous Gly1076Val mutation. Two patients, one with PEO, exercise intolerance, and gastrointestinal dysmotility and the other with PEO, neuropathy, deafness, and hypogonadism, both had a Pro587Leu change. The fourth patient, who was compound heterozygous for Ala889Thr and Arg579Trp mutations, had PEO, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and neuropathy. These mutations were not detected in 120 healthy control alleles. Our results demonstrate that POLG mutations account for a substantial proportion of patients (13%) with PEO and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions and cause both clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders."}

The first case was a 64-years-old man with bacteremia, spondylitis and psoas abscesses caused by MRSA. He was treated with arbekacin (ABK) and vancomycin (VCM), and then became afebrile. However he complained of a recurrence of fever and oliguria, we administered linezolid for two weeks intravenously because of fluctuating renal dysfunction. Thereafter his clinical conditions improved. The second case was a 26-years-old man with MRSA infection of the pelvis after a trauma. He was treated with teicoplanin (TEIC) for two weeks. However the minimum inhibiratory concentrations (MICs) of TEIC and VCM against MRSA, isolated from the wounds, were 4 micrograms/ml each, we administered linezolid intravenously and the patient was successfully treated in four weeks. Linezolid has been proven to have high efficacy against MRSA by some trials abroad. But the agent has the indication only for VRE by the Medical Insurance in Japan. These cases also suggest that linezolid is useful for MRSA infections in these cases."}

The BAC library currently consists of 2x genome coverage with an average insert size of 80 kb. The fosmid library is at 11x genome coverage with an average insert of 40 kb. B. schlosseri is a small organism containing a large number of compounds that hinder DNA purification. Thus a number of protocols had to be modified in order to make purified, high molecular weight inserts for cloning, including both gel purification and insert concentration techniques. Both libraries were characterized by using them in initial physical mapping of a single histocompatibility locus, and were found to be representative and functional. These libraries are important tools for physical mapping and positional cloning in the B. schlosseri genome, and the techniques adapted to make them are suitable for use on other organisms in which high molecular weight DNA is difficult to purify."}

This prospective study was designed to test the utility of CVR in congenital hydrocephalus (CHC). Patients (n = 21, mean age 6.2 m) with CHC underwent a baseline ultrasonography (US), retinal fundus examination (RF), neurological score (NS), and SPECT to evaluate CVR after intravenous ACZ. Monthly US, RF, NS, CBF, and CVR were evaluated. Ten patients showed good CVR and also had stable NS and RF despite mild to moderate ventriculomegaly and were followed up on conservative treatment. None of these patients in a mean follow-up period of 9.8 months showed deterioration. Eleven patients, who had poor CVR initially, were also treated conservatively. Over a period of 4 months, 8 patients showed a fall in CVR to < 30 % of baseline and a fall in NS despite RF and US remaining the same and hence were operated. Five of these operated cases showed an improvement in CVR and NS over a mean follow-up period of 4 months and the remaining 3 patients failed to show improvement in CVR and NS. In CHC, CVR measured by ACZ challenge test is a sensitive parameter as alterations in CVR occur prior to changes in other conventional parameters such as ventriculomegaly and RF. Patients with normal CVR at presentation are unlikely to deteriorate and can safely be managed conservatively. Patients who show a deterioration in CVR should be considered for prompt surgery."}

After aerosol administration, pulmonary concentrations of p53 plasmid were high and other organs showed amounts not distinguishable from untreated control. High concentrations of p53 plasmid in the lungs remained with negligible reduction for at least 24 h. Shortly after intravenous injection, organs exhibited the following relative levels of exogenously administered p53: liver > spleen > blood > or = lungs > heart > kidney. These results demonstrate effective pulmonary delivery of DNA in complex with PEI by aerosol, without significant systemic dissemination. In contrast, intravenous administration caused a prompt systemic distribution of DNA with a shorter half-life of the administered gene in the lungs."}

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that control melanoma cell resistance and searched for chemotherapeutic drugs that could overcome the TRAIL resistance in melanoma cells. We examined 21 melanoma cell lines and 3 primary melanoma cultures for their sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and then tested cisplatin, chemptothecin, and etoposide for their synergistic effects on TRAIL sensitivity in resistant melanoma cells. Of 21 melanoma cell lines, 11 showed various degrees of sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through caspase-8-initiated cleavage of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation factor 45. The remaining cell lines and primary cultures were resistant to TRAIL, but cisplatin, chemptothecin, and etoposide sensitized the resistant cell lines and primary cultures to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, which also occurred through the caspase-8-initiated caspase cascade. Of the two TRAIL death receptors (DR4 and DR5), melanoma cells primarily expressed DR5 on cell surface. Cisplatin treatment had no effects on cell surface DR5 expression or intracellular expression of Fas-associated death domain and caspase-8. Instead, cisplatin treatment down-regulated intracellular expression of the short form of cellular Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) and inhibited phosphorylation of the long form of c-FLIP. The results presented here indicate that cisplatin inhibits c-FLIP protein expression and phosphorylation to restore TRAIL-induced caspase-8-initiated apoptosis in melanoma cells, thus providing a new combined therapeutic strategy for melanomas."}

Serial endoscopic assessment and systematic biopsy at the oesophagogastric anastomosis was undertaken in 40 patients following curative radical subtotal oesophagectomy and reconstruction with a gastric conduit subjected to a pyloroplasty. Thirty patients subsequently underwent combined 24-h ambulatory pH and bilirubin monitoring. Grade I-III oesophagitis was identified in 14 patients and oesophageal columnar epithelium in 19 patients. Biopsies from columnar regeneration revealed cardiac-type epithelium in ten patients and intestinal metaplasia in nine. Seven patients followed serially showed progression from cardiac-type epithelium to intestinal metaplasia. The incidence of Barrett's metaplasia was similar irrespective of the histological subtype of the resected tumour. Patients with oesophageal columnar epithelium had significantly higher acid (P = 0.015) and bilirubin (P = 0.011) reflux. Severe DGOR occurs following subtotal oesophagectomy and provides an environment for the acquisition of Barrett's metaplasia via a sequence of cardiac epithelium and eventual intestinal metaplasia."}

Independent questionnaire data (Child Behavior Checklist, ADHD Rating Scale-IV, ODD Rating Scale-IV, Conners Hyperactivity Index) were collected. For comparison 131 children without ADHD were matched for sex, age, marital status, and socioeconomic status (115 males, 16 females; mean age 4 years 10 months, SD 1 year 5 months; range 3 to 7 years). Sixty percent of those with ADHD met full DSM-IV criteria for ODD. Only 10 of the 131 children with ADHD had no symptoms of ODD at all. The rate of children meeting full diagnostic criteria for ODD was similar across all age cohorts. Males were overrepresented in ODD, as were children of divorced parents and of mothers with low socioeconomic status. ADHD combined subtype was a stable independent factor influencing the diagnosis of ODD, regardless of psychosocial factors. Those with ADHD with ODD consistently showed higher rates of ADHD symptoms than did those with ADHD without ODD. The prevalent comorbidity of ADHD with ODD indicates that all children presenting with ADHD or ODD symptoms need to be assessed with a view to exploring both types of problem behaviours. The link between ODD and some psychosocial variables indicates the need to address these, possibly by measures such as parent training and network support."}

In this study, we investigated the effects of two polyphenols, quercetin and resveratrol, on red blood cell Band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation signalling activated by peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite is a physiological oxidant scavenged largely by the erythrocyte and formed by the reaction between nitrogen monoxide and superoxide anion. Quercetin and its structurally analogous (+)-catechin inhibited the peroxynitrite-dependent upregulation of Band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Quercetin was found to downregulate the activity of syk, which is upstream in the Band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation cascade, and partially prevented peroxynitrite-mediated phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibition. Resveratrol and hydroxytyrosol, unexpectedly, amplified peroxynitrite-dependent upregulation of Band 3 tyrosine phosphorylation through the activation of lyn, a kinase of the src family. The present results clearly indicate that polyphenols may activate cell transduction pathways in different and sometimes opposite ways."}

Its role in myofibroblast differentiation is, however, unknown. We studied the expression and the localization of SRF in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, where myofibroblasts are abundant. We found that SRF levels were upregulated in bleomycin-exposed mouse lungs mainly due to de novo synthesis of SRFDelta5, a less myogenic SRF isoform. Before myofibroblast differentiation, SRF/SRFDelta5 was immunolocalized mostly in the cytoplasm of scattered fibroblasts at lesion sites. With the development of myofibroblasts, however, SRF/SRFDelta5 was found in myofibroblast nuclei. cDNA array analysis showed that SRFDelta5 and SRF induced expression of transforming growth factor-beta1, a critical factor in myofibroblast differentiation. This was accompanied by de novo expression of several inflammatory cell-specific mRNAs. The latter was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Treatment of lung fibroblasts with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which is produced early in the bleomycin model, induced SRFDelta5 expression and SRF/SRFDelta5 cytoplasmic accumulation, whereas addition of transforming growth factor-beta1 caused SRF/SRFDelta5 nuclear translocation followed by SM alpha-actin synthesis. Interleukin-4, another cytokine involved in myofibroblast differentiation, did not affect SRF or induce SRFDelta5 expression. Our studies therefore suggested a new mechanism whereby SRF and SRFDelta5 contribute to the emergence of myofibroblasts in lung injury and fibrosis."}

Postoperative follow-up 6 months later showed no evidence of tumor regrowth in either case.

Nitrite might yield nitrosamines in vivo but ascorbic acid (vitamin C) could counteract these potential ill effects. The aim of this study is to determine whether ascorbic acid would interfere with the ability of sodium nitrite to suppress growth and acid production of S. mutans, NCTC 10449(T) and NCTC 10832. Strains were grown in Fastidious Anaerobe Broth before exposure to 200 mM nitrite in the presence of various concentrations of ascorbic acid (0.0, 5.7, 11.4, 17.0, 22.7, 28.4, 56.8, 85.2 mM). End pH was measured after 24 h exposure and cultures were serially diluted for viable counts. Statistical significance of differences in end pH values, each from 10 experiments, was determined using the Mann-Whitney U-Test. At all concentrations of ascorbic acid plus 200 mM nitrite plus S. mutans the pH was higher than with controls lacking ascorbic acid and/or nitrite (p>/=0.001). S. mutans was viable (between 4.5 x 10 (8) and 7.9 x 10 (9) cfuml (-1)) after growth in the presence of ascorbic acid at all concentrations without nitrite, whereas it was not detected when 200 mM nitrite was also present. ascorbic acid does not prevent the action of nitrite against S. mutans. Therefore ascorbic acid could be used in conjunction with nitrite to help counteract potential ill effects for humans."}

When the fall of blood pressure after phenoxybenzamine was prevented by repeated injections of vasopressin, the urinary excretion of noradrenaline did not rise. Hydergine and hydrallazine reduced the blood pressure without raising the urinary excretion of noradrenaline. In dogs, the infusion of small amounts of noradrenaline led to a significantly higher urinary recovery of the amine after phenoxybenzamine than before. It is concluded that antisympathomimetic drugs interfere with the destruction in the body of noradrenaline, whether released reflexly in hypotension or injected."}

Obesity's effects on the vascular systems of young adults and African Americans have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to assess the association between measures of obesity and aortic stiffness in 186 young adults (20 to 40 years, 50% African American) and 177 older adults (41 to 70 years, 33% African American). Aortic stiffness was measured by aortic pulse-wave velocity. The median pulse-wave velocity value was 468 cm/s for young adults and 627 cm/s for older adults (P<0.001). Higher body weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, and waist-hip ratio were strongly correlated with higher pulse-wave velocity, independent of age, systolic blood pressure, race, and sex overall and among both age groups (P<0.01 for all). Even among the 20- to 30-year-olds, obese individuals (body mass index>30) had a mean pulse-wave velocity value 47 cm/s higher than did nonobese individuals (P<0.001). Obesity measures were among the strongest independent predictors of pulse-wave velocity overall and for both age groups. Results were consistent by race. In conclusion, excess body weight is associated with higher aortic stiffness in whites and African Americans as young as 20 to 30 years. The strength of the association, the early age at which it appears, and the prevalence of obesity among the young warn of substantially increased cardiovascular disease incidence as this cohort ages."}

Whereas the tendency toward specialization has led to greater knowledge of the scientific aspects of allergic phenomena, it has somewhat diverted the specialists' attention from the many clinical problems that await solution. Effective treatment of the allergic patient depends in no small measure on the broad viewpoint and clinical experience of the internist. This fact has been reemphasized by the growing awareness of the significance of the secondary or precipitating causes, such as climatic, nutritional, hormonal and psychogenic factors which influence allergic manifestations. Overemphasis on specialization in allergic diseases with their wide ramifications may defeat the main objective-a successful therapeutic result. To meet this challenge, the internist should be trained in allergy and yet retain a broad approach to the more basic problems of internal medicine. This objective may be attained by certain modifications in undergraduate medical instruction in allergy. Postgraduate training sponsored by our national allergy societies affords internists an excellent opportunity to advance their knowledge of clinical allergy."}
{"pmid": "12800405", "title": "Arterial wall thermography.", "abstract": "An atherosclerotic plaque is considered vulnerable when it is at higher risk of inducing acute cardiac events. The early detection and follow-up of the vulnerable plaque are crucial to prevent these events from happening. To date there are no proven techniques to detect such a plaque. Arterial wall thermography, tracing the heat signature of the activated macrophages, is a new and promising method in this direction. However, the difficulties of applying such a method in vivo should not be neglected. Current science proposes several potential thermographic methods. They can be generally categorized as noninvasive and invasive. Magnetic resonance thermometry (MRT) is the most important noninvasive method. It is novel, accurate, and reproducible, but is unfortunately hampered by resolution limitations due to the size and motion of the target vessels. The \"infrared\" and the \"contact-sensor\" are the most important invasive thermographic methods. Mainly due to the difficulties of infrared radiation in penetrating the flowing blood, the contact thermographic methods seem to be the most feasible at present. The superiority of thermal mapping of the arterial wall versus the localized temperature measurements is clear. The use of multiple thermal sensors arranged around the vessel's circumference and the application of motorized catheter pullback, not only ensure a large area of coverage, but also enable us to build thermal maps and vascular thermoanatomical reconstructions by using modern computer technology. It is expected that arterial thermography will undoubtedly initiate debate, mainly concerning the most appropriate therapy for the vulnerable plaque. Data collection and correct interpretation are expected to lead us into making wise decisions."}

Role of the c-Abl and Arg tyrosine kinases.", "abstract": "Catalase is a major effector in the defense of aerobic cells against oxidative stress. Recent studies have shown that catalase activity is stimulated by the c-Abl and Arg tyrosine kinases. Little, however, is otherwise known about the mechanisms responsible for catalase regulation. The present work demonstrates that mouse cells deficient in both c-Abl and Arg exhibit increased catalase stability. The results also show that catalase is subject to ubiquitination and degradation by the 26S proteosome. Significantly, ubiquitination of catalase is dependent on c-Abl- and Arg-mediated phosphorylation of catalase on both Y231 and Y386. In concert with these results, human 293 cells expressing catalase mutated at Y231 and Y386 exhibit attenuated levels of reactive oxygen species when exposed to hydrogen peroxide. These findings indicate that, in addition to stimulating catalase activity, c-Abl and Arg promote catalase degradation in the oxidative stress response."}

PPAR and PPAR have been implicated in colonic malignancy. Here we provide three lines of evidence suggesting an inhibitory role for PPAR in colorectal cancer development. Levels of PPAR mRNA and protein in human colorectal cancers were compared with matched non-malignant mucosa using RNAse protection and western blotting. APC(Min)/+ mice were randomised to receive the PPAR activator methylclofenapate 25 mg/kg or vehicle for up to 16 weeks, and small and large intestinal polyps were quantified by image analysis. The effect of methylclofenapate on serum stimulated mitogenesis (thymidine incorporation), linear cell growth, and annexin V and propidium iodide staining were assessed in human colonic epithelial cells. PPAR (mRNA and protein) expression levels were significantly depressed in colorectal cancer compared with matched non-malignant tissue. Methylclofenapate reduced polyp area in the small intestine from 18.7 mm(2) (median (interquartile range 11.1, 26.8)) to 9.90 (4.88, 13.21) mm(2) (p=0.003) and in the colon from 9.15 (6.31, 10.5) mm(2) to 3.71 (2.71, 5.99) mm(2) (p=0.009). Methylclofenapate significantly reduced thymidine incorporation and linear cell growth with no effect on annexin V or propidium iodide staining. PPAR may inhibit colorectal tumour progression, possibly via inhibition of proliferation, and may be an important therapeutic target."}

Isolated aortic tissues were exposed to ADM, PAMP and ADT for 2 h. The NO production, indicated by nitrite content in the incubated media, and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in the incubated tissues were assayed. Nitrite productions and NOS activities of the aortic tissues were significantly increased by ADM in a concentration-dependent manner. The nitrite production and NOS activity of the aortic tissues stimulated by ADM (10(-8) mol.L-1) incubation were (0.282 +/- 0.046) mumol per mg protein and (0.323 +/- 0.056) pmol.min-1 per mg protein, respectively, which were greater than those of the control (0.173 +/- 0.026) mumol per mg protein and (0.110 +/- 0.028) pmol.min-1 per mg protein (P < 0.01), respectively. The nitrite production and NOS activity were (0.204 +/- 0.049) mumol per mg protein and(0.178 +/- 0.023) pmol.min-1 per mg protein when the tissues were treated with ADM (10(-8) mol.L-1) and PAMP (10(-8) mol.L-1) in combination, and were (0.150 +/- 0.036) mumol per mg protein and (0.123 +/- 0.031) pmol.min-1 per mg protein when ADM (10(-8) mol.L-1) and ADT (10(-8) mol.L-1) were used in combination, which were significantly less than those in ADM (10(-8) mol.L-1) group. After incubation of the aortic tissues with the same concentrations(10(-8) mol.L-1) of ADM, PAMP and ADT in combination, the nitrite production and NOS activity were (0.162 +/- 0.029) mumol per mg protein and (0.110 +/- 0.024) pmol.min-1 per mg protein, which were also greatly reduced as compared with those of the ADM group (10(-8) mol.L-1, P < 0.01). However, neither PAMP nor ADT had effect on the production of nitrite and NOS activity in the aortic tissues. ADM enhanced the NO production in rat aorta, which was antagonized by PAMP and ADT alone or in combination through influencing the NOS activity."}

This systematic review addresses the question of whether there are social or ethnic inequalities in attendance for antenatal care in the United Kingdom. We identified and reviewed UK studies assessing attendance for antenatal care according to any measure of social class, social deprivation or ethnicity. A wide range of electronic databases was searched for published and unpublished studies. Further studies were identified from reference lists, citation searches and key organizations. From over 1300 identified papers, 20 were potentially relevant. Nine were included in the review. Most studies were of poor quality, with only one study controlling for the effect of potential confounders such as age, parity and clinical risk factors. All but one were based on data collected around 20 years ago. Three of the five studies looking at antenatal attendance and social class found that women from manual classes were more likely to book late for antenatal care and/or make fewer antenatal visits than other women. All four studies reporting on antenatal attendance and ethnicity found that women of Asian origin were more likely to book late for antenatal care than white British women. There is little good quality evidence on social and ethnic inequalities in attendance for antenatal care in the United Kingdom. Recommendations for further research are suggested."}

Purification and structural characterization of nawaprin from Naja nigricollis snake venom.", "abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of nawaprin has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This 51-amino acid residue peptide was isolated from the venom of the spitting cobra, Naja nigricollis, and is the first member of a new family of snake venom proteins referred to as waprins. Nawaprin is relatively flat and disc-like in shape, characterized by a spiral backbone configuration that forms outer and inner circular segments. The two circular segments are held together by four disulfide bonds, three of which are clustered at the base of the molecule. The inner segment contains a short antiparallel beta-sheet, whereas the outer segment is devoid of secondary structures except for a small turn or 310 helix. The structure of nawaprin is very similar to elafin, a human leukocyte elastase-specific inhibitor. Although substantial parts of the nawaprin molecule are well defined, the tips of the outer and inner circular segments, which are hypothesized to be critical for binding interactions, are apparently disordered, similar to that found in elafin. The amino acid residues in these important regions in nawaprin are different from those in elafin, suggesting that nawaprin is not an elastase-specific inhibitor and therefore has a different function in the snake venom."}

The infection may have derived from scrapie in sheep, a spontaneous genetic mutation in cattle, or a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in another mammalian species. Experimental work on the risk of transmission has necessarily tried to identify risk materials and their infectivity levels, the nature and size of species barriers, the infectious dose, the route of infection, the strain of the agent and the genotype of the animals at risk. The identification of levels of infection in cattle tissues has aided the removal of risk materials from the human and animal food chains. Maternally associated transmission is unlikely to maintain an outbreak, but the offspring of clinical cases appear to be at greater risk when the rate of food-borne exposure is high. Studies of embryo transfer have not shown infection to be transmitted by this means. While the control measures appeared to be straightforward, compliance has at times proved difficult to enforce and quantify. This has necessitated more extensive prohibitions, aggressive enforcement and thorough auditing of compliance levels."}

They are more frequent in diffuse large B cell (DLBCL) and follicular lymphomas (FL). This study aims to analyse the presence and distribution of BCL-6 gene mutations in a large series of primary bone lymphomas (PBL), a rare extranodal presentation of NHL frequently associated with diffuse large cell morphology. Fifty-three cases of PBL were examined. Mutations were detected with non-radioisotopic polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and visualized with fluorescent cycle sequencing. Among stage I(E) PBL, there were 30 cases of DLBCL and one each of follicular, anaplastic large cell and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The stage II(E) PBL included six DLBCL and one lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, whereas within stage IV PBL there were 12 DLBCL and one Burkitt lymphoma. Fifteen patients (28%) displayed mutational events. In nine cases there were more than one BCL-6 mutation. Only DLBCL displayed mutations (31%). Mutations included single base-pair substitutions (16 transitions and ten transversions) and a single point insertion (ins A 427-28). The frequency of mutations resulted lower in DLBCL of the PBL category than in the majority of other extranodal large cell lymphomas. The prevalence of mutations was higher in stage I(E) PBL than in more advanced stages of the disease (II(E) + IV) ( p=0.02). Our results reinforce the observation of heterogeneity of the DLBCL included in the clinical category of PBL."}

Their medical records and radiological investigations were reviewed and cerebral angiographies were thoroughly examined in arterial, capillary, and venous phases. In ten cases, marked or moderate tumor staining was found whereas the staining was either scanty or absent in seven cases. In the ten cases showing marked or moderate tumor staining, the feeding vessels were originated from the ipsilateral carotid and/or vertebro-basilar system. In the venous phase, the ipsilateral thalamostriate vein, tortuous and enlarged, was elevated, and the internal cerebral vein was depressed. Thus, the venous angle of the ipsilateral side was widened at an irregular contour. Based on the characteristic displacement and the increased size of the associated venous system, it is suggested that the central neurocytoma might originate from a neuronal cell mass of the subependymal zone located on the floor of the lateral ventricle around the foramen of Monro rather than from the septum pellucidum."}
{"pmid": "12856557", "title": "Preventing medical errors by designing benign failures.", "abstract": "One way to successfully reduce medical errors is to design health care systems that are more resistant to the tendencies of human beings to err. One interdisciplinary approach entails creating design changes, mitigating human errors, and making human error irrelevant to outcomes. This approach is intended to facilitate the creation of benign failures, which have been called mistake-proofing devices and forcing functions elsewhere. USING FAULT TREES TO DESIGN FORCING FUNCTIONS: A fault tree is a graphical tool used to understand the relationships that either directly cause or contribute to the cause of a particular failure. A careful analysis of a fault tree enables the analyst to anticipate how the process will behave after the change. EXAMPLE OF AN APPLICATION: A scenario in which a patient is scalded while bathing can serve as an example of how multiple fault trees can be used to design forcing functions. The first fault tree shows the undesirable event--patient scalded while bathing. The second fault tree has a benign event--no water. Adding a scald valve changes the outcome from the undesirable event (\"patient scalded while bathing\") to the benign event (\"no water\") Analysis of fault trees does not ensure or guarantee that changes necessary to eliminate error actually occur. Most mistake-proofing is used to prevent simple errors and to create well-defended processes, but complex errors can also result. The utilization of mistake-proofing or forcing functions can be thought of as changing the logic of a process. Errors that formerly caused undesirable failures can be converted into the causes of benign failures. The use of fault trees can provide a variety of insights into the design of forcing functions that will improve patient safety."}

The quantitative relations between externally applied potential and the resulting potential generated within the system are analyzed in order to obtain information about the kinetics of the electromotance,-potential,-and chemical changes taking place during excitation. The following preliminary conclusions are drawn: A depolarizing and a repolarizing process (positive and negative electromotance) increase and decrease with the potential. For a sudden potential displacement the negative electromotance reaches its new value at a faster rate than the positive electromotance. Since the individual values of the two electromotances depend on the potential and since they both generate a potential which is proportional to the difference of their absolute values, the values of either electromotance are determined by this difference as well as by any externally induced potential change."}

Stepwise paths through polarized diradical intermediates are always preferred. These intermediates have unusual properties, involving high rotational barriers about formally single bonds, which permit them to maintain stereochemical relationships. The diradicals may exchange the RNO moiety between the two ends of the alkene via an aziridine N-oxide. The aziridine N-oxide cannot be accessed directly from reactants and cannot lead directly to ene products. It is therefore an innocent by-stander in the way proposed by Singleton for the aziridinium imide in the ene reactions of triazolinediones. A detailed analysis of the electronic structure of the polarized diradicals is given. The kinetic isotope effects measured in a Stephenson isotope effect test have been reproduced. These kinetic isotope effects are consistent with a mechanism in which partitioning of the polarized diradical between cyclization to an aziridine N-oxide and H-abstraction to ene product takes place, and in which the formation of the polarized diradical is to some extent reversible. Finally, calculated regioselectivities reproduce those observed experimentally."}

This activity is in turn controlled by neural circuits in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia. During urine storage, the outlet is closed and the bladder smooth muscle is quiescent. When bladder volume reaches the micturition threshold, activation of a micturition center in the dorsolateral pons (the pontine micturition center) induces a bladder contraction and a reciprocal relaxation of the urethra, leading to bladder emptying. During voiding, sacral parasympathetic (pelvic) nerves provide an excitatory input (cholinergic and purinergic) to the bladder and inhibitory input (nitrergic) to the urethra. The brain rostral to the pons (diencephalon and cerebral cortex) is also involved in excitatory and inhibitory regulation of the micturition reflex. Various transmitters including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, opioids, acetylcholine, and neuropeptides are implicated in the modulation of the micturition reflex in the central nervous system. Therefore, injury or diseases of the nervous system, as well as drugs and disorders of the peripheral organs, can produce bladder and urethral dysfunctions such as urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence, or inefficient bladder emptying."}

The renin-angiotensin system mediates at least part of this hypertension. Enalaprilat, the only intravenous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is used to treat hypertension in pediatric patients in other settings. However, its effect on postoperative hypertension during the early postoperative period in patients undergoing surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta is unknown. Prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Operating room and the pediatric intensive care unit. Fourteen consecutive pediatric patients between the ages of 1 and 18 yrs scheduled to undergo surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta. Patients were randomized to receive enalaprilat or saline placebo. Infusions were begun intraoperatively within 15 mins of aortic repair and repeated every 6 hrs. Plasma renin activity was measured at baseline and on postoperative day 1. Blood pressure was determined at 30 mins and at 2, 4, and 6 hrs after infusion and scored relative to the preoperative blood pressure. The blood pressure in the enalaprilat group was consistently lower at 30 mins, 2 hrs, and 4 hrs after infusion (p <.05), but not at 6 hrs. Plasma renin activity was significantly lower in the placebo group on postoperative day 1. Length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit trended shorter in the treated group. Conclusions are limited by a small cohort. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy resulted in improved blood pressure control after coarctation repair. Further improvement of blood pressure control may be achievable by use of a larger dose of enalaprilat or a 4-hr enalaprilat-dosing interval."}

Genetic data together with high-resolution X-ray structures corresponding to snapshots of the assembly process reveal the structural basis of fiber formation. Comparison of chaperone bound Caf1 subunit with the subunit in the fiber reveals a novel type of conformational change involving the entire hydrophobic core of the protein. The observed conformational change suggests that the chaperone traps a high-energy folding intermediate of Caf1. A model is proposed in which release of the subunit allows folding to be completed, driving fiber formation."}

{"pmid": "12921410", "title": "Optimal data selection: revision, review, and reevaluation.", "abstract": "Since it first appeared, there has been much research and critical discussion on the theory of optimal data selection as an explanation of Wason's (1966,1968) selection task (Oaksford & Chater, 1994). In this paper, this literature is reviewed, and the theory of optimal data selection is reevaluated in its light. The information gain model is first located in the current theoretical debate in the psychology of reasoning concerning dual processes in human reasoning. A model comparison exercise is then presented that compares a revised version of the model with its theoretical competitors. Tests of the novel predictions of the model are then reviewed. This section also reviews experiments claimed not to be consistent with optimal data selection. Finally, theoretical criticisms of optimal data selection are discussed. It is argued either that the revised model accounts for them or that they do not stand up under analysis. It is concluded that some version of the optimal data selection model still provides the best account of the selection task. Consequently, the conclusion of Oaksford and Chater's (1994) original rational analysis (Anderson, 1990), that people's hypothesis-testing behavior on this task is rational and well adapted to the environment, still stands."}
{"pmid": "14514358", "title": "The heat shock protein 90 of Plasmodium falciparum and antimalarial activity of its inhibitor, geldanamycin.", "abstract": "The naturally occurring benzoquinone ansamycin compound, geldanamycin (GA), is a specific inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and is a potential anticancer agent. Since Plasmodium falciparum has been reported to have an Hsp90 ortholog, we tested the possibility that GA might inhibit it and thereby display antiparasitic activity. We provide direct recombinant DNA evidence for the Hsp90 protein of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of fatal malaria. While the mRNA of Hsp90 was mainly expressed in ring and trophozoite stages, the protein was found in all stages, although schizonts contained relatively lower amounts. In vitro the parasitic Hsp90 exhibited an ATP-binding activity that could be specifically inhibited by GA. Plasmodium growth in human erythrocyte culture was strongly inhibited by GA with an IC50 of 20 nM, compared to the IC50 of 15 nM for chloroquine (CQ) under identical conditions. When used in combination, the two drugs acted synergistically. GA was equally effective against CQ-sensitive and CQ-resistant strains (3D7 and W2, respectively) and on all erythrocytic stages of the parasite. Together, these results suggest that an active and essential Hsp90 chaperone cycle exists in Plasmodium and that the ansamycin antibiotics will be an important tool to dissect its role in the parasite. Additionally, the favorable pharmacology of GA, reported in human trials, makes it a promising antimalarial drug."}

Anecdotal reports of isolates with divergent in vitro susceptibilities to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have been published. To determine the prevalence of pneumococcal isolates with divergent ceftriaxone and cefotaxime susceptibilities, we tested 1,000 clinical isolates collected by U.S. laboratories in 2001-2002 by broth microdilution and E-test. The percentages of isolates susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were significantly different by both broth microdilution (98.6 and 96.6%, respectively; P < 0.05) and E-test (98.3 and 95.8%; P < 0.001). The differences observed were due solely to the activities of the two agents against penicillin-resistant isolates. Twenty-six of 188 penicillin-resistant isolates (13.8%) demonstrated different ceftriaxone and cefotaxime MIC interpretative phenotypes when tested by broth microdilution; 18 isolates were concurrently ceftriaxone susceptible and cefotaxime intermediate, 6 were ceftriaxone intermediate and cefotaxime resistant, and 2 were ceftriaxone susceptible and cefotaxime resistant (1.1% of penicillin-resistant isolates; 0.2% of all isolates tested). Sixteen of the 26 isolates (65%) were from southern U.S. states. The 26 isolates had serogroups and serotypes (6, 9, 14, 19, and 23) commonly associated with penicillin-resistant isolates; SmaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified 18 isolates (69%) dispersed among five subtype groups and 8 isolates that were unrelated to any of the other isolates. We conclude that certain isolates of penicillin-resistant pneumococci are less susceptible to cefotaxime than to ceftriaxone and that these isolates are not the result of the spread of a single clone. Whether such isolates have increased in prevalence over time remains unknown."}

We treated 20 patients with distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. They were classified as infracallosa, located at the genu of the corpus callosum and supracallosal. Specialized anesthetic methods, Sugita head holder, and microsurgical techniques were utilized. Approaches were modified regarding aneurysm localization and multiplicity. Patients were evaluated six months after surgery. Glasgow Outcome Scale was applied. Thirteen patients (65%) were between 31 and 45 years of age. All were operated on at Grade I or II of the World Federation Neurological Surgeon Scale. There were multiple aneurysms in 35% of the cases. All of the aneurysms were 11 mm long or less in diameter. The segment of the distal anterior cerebral artery next to the genu of the corpus callosum was the most commonly involved (65%). 16 (80%) patients made a complete postoperative recovery of. There were not deaths. Distal anterior, cerebral artery aneurysms were not frequent and they needed special management. Their high tendency to multiplicity and early bleeding were two main characteristics. As they are midline located, they permit to perform small size craniotomy.

To determine the presence and nature of such an HIV-1-specific immune response, we evaluated the quantity and fine specificity of HIV-1-reactive IFN-gamma-secreting T cells in a group of highly exposed seronegative men having sex with men. All 46 ES reported frequent unprotected anal sex with known HIV-1-infected partners at enrollment, and high risk activities continued in at least one-half of the volunteers for up to >6 years of observation. Despite the high frequency of unprotected anal intercourse and potential HIV-1 exposure, the vast majority of individuals demonstrated no or very low numbers of HIV-1-specific, IFN-gamma-secreting T cells. Even when HIV-1 epitopes were presented by peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in 15 of the highest risk volunteers, HIV-1-specific T cells remained infrequent, and the proportion of responders was not significantly different from that in a lower risk seronegative control cohort. Only PBMC from two individuals who have remained uninfected to date exhibited distinctly positive responses. However, these responses rarely persisted over time, single epitope specificities were identified in only one volunteer, and HIV-1-specific memory T cell clones did not expand in vitro. HIV-1-specific, IFN-gamma-secreting T cells are thus unlikely to substantially contribute to resistance against infection in most exposed seronegative men having sex with men."}

In this current preliminary study, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to investigate the biochemical effects of differing concentrations of pyruvate (3 and 15mM) on liver metabolism during the cold hypoxic preservation period itself, in order to gain insight into possible mechanisms. Hepatic lactate, alanine, and succinate levels were increased in livers preserved with 15mM pyruvate added to the University of Wisconsin (UW) solution and were generally elevated (but to a lesser degree) in livers flushed with 3mM pyruvate, compared to those cold stored in UW alone. Further, from enzymatic assays of adenine nucleotides, 15mM levels of pyruvate were found to maintain higher ATP levels during short periods (up to 4h) of cold hypoxic storage than in UW stored livers, whilst energy charge ratios (after 4 and 24h) were also higher (P<0.01 in each case). This may arise from enhanced glycolysis secondary to an improved redox status in the pyruvate-treated livers, as evident by the increase in the levels of lactate."}

The abundance of Skp2 mRNA oscillates in a cell cycle-dependent manner, being maximal in S and G(2) phases. The regulation of Skp2 transcription was investigated by cloning the promoter region of the mouse gene and determination of its activity in a luciferase reporter assay. Deletion analysis identified a minimal approximately 0.3-kb promoter region with marked transcriptional activity and a 105-bp essential sequence within this region. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated the presence in nuclear extracts of proteins that bind to this sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the core binding motif, CACTTCCG, which is similar to that of GA-binding protein (GABP), is essential for Skp2 transcription. \"Supershift\" analysis indicated that the protein-probe complexes detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays contain GABP. Endogenous GABP bound to Skp2 promoter element in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Furthermore, overexpression of GABPbeta increased Skp2 promoter activity, and suppression of GABPalpha or GABPbeta by a small interfering RNA resulted in the reduction of Skp2 promoter activity. These data suggest that the cell cycle-dependent binding of GABP to the Skp2 promoter plays an important role in the regulation of Skp2 expression and cell cycle progression from G(1) to S phase."}

We have evaluated the influence of the host cellular microenvironment upon the survival, differentiation, and integration of neural progenitor cells transplanted into the CNS. Using this approach, we have investigated the fate of neural progenitor cells in vivo following transplantation into the developing mammalian eye. Murine brain progenitor cells (mBPCs) isolated from neonatal mice expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene were transplanted into the eyes of Brazilian opossums (Monodelphis domestica). Monodelphis pups are born in an extremely immature, fetal-like state. The eyes of neonatal pups provide a fetal-like environment in which to study cellular interactions between host tissues and transplanted neural progenitor cells. mBPCs were transplanted by intraocular injection in hosts ranging in age from 5 days postnatal to adult. The transplanted cells were easily identified because of their GFP fluorescence. Extensive survival, differentiation, and morphological integration of mBPCs within the host tissue was observed. We found that the younger retinas provided a more supportive environment for the morphological integration of the transplanted mBPCs. Cells with morphologies characteristic of specific retinal cell types were observed. Moreover, some transplanted mBPCs were labeled with antibodies characteristic of specific neural/retinal phenotypes. These results suggest that the host environment strongly influences progenitor cell differentiation and that transplantation of neural progenitor cells may be a useful approach aimed at treating degeneration and pathology of the CNS."}

PPAR gamma+/- mice are resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity and thus PPAR gamma may mediate physiological responses to dietary fat in other mammals. The aim of this study was to determine whether the human PPAR gamma proline to alanine substitution polymorphism (Pro12Ala) modifies the association between dietary fat and adiposity and plasma lipids. Subjects (n=2141) were controls selected for three case-control studies nested within the Nurses' Health Study, a large ongoing prospective cohort study. Associations between intake of total fat, fat subtypes and BMI were different in PPAR gamma 12Ala variant allele-carriers compared with non-carriers. Among homozygous wild-type Pro/Pro individuals, those in the highest quintile of total fat intake, had significantly higher mean body mass index (BMI) compared with those in the lowest quintile (27.3 versus 25.4 kg/m2, respectively; P-trend<0.0001) whereas among 12Ala variant allele-carriers there was no significant trend observed between dietary fat intake and BMI (P-trend=0.99; P-interaction=0.003). In contrast, intake of monounsaturated fat was not associated with BMI among homozygous wild-type women but was inversely associated with BMI among 12Ala variant allele-carriers (mean in lowest quintile=27.6 versus mean in highest quintile=25.5 kg/m2; P-trend=0.006; P-interaction=0.003). The relationship between dietary fat intake and plasma lipid concentrations also differed according to PPAR gamma genotype. These data suggest that PPAR gamma genotype is an important factor in physiological responses to dietary fat in humans."}

However, all A(1)A(O) ATPase preparations reported to date contained only three to six subunits and, therefore, the study of this unique class of secondary energy converters is still in its infancy. To improve the quality of A(1)A(O) ATPase preparations, we chose the hyperthermophilic, methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii as a model organism. Individual subunits of the A(1)A(O) ATPase from M. jannaschii were produced in E. coli, purified, and antibodies were raised. The antibodies enabled the development of a protocol ensuring purification of the entire nine-subunit A(1)A(O) ATPase. The ATPase was solubilized from membranes of M. jannaschii by Triton X-100 and purified to apparent homogeneity by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Electron micrographs revealed the A(1) and A(O) domains and the central stalk, but also additional masses which could represent a second stalk. Inhibitor studies were used to demonstrate that the A(1) and A(O) domains are functionally coupled.

But it doesn't have to be that way, argue the authors. In evaluating acquisitions, companies must look beyond the lure of profits the income statement promises and examine the balance sheet, where the company keeps track of capital. It's ignoring the balance sheet that causes so many acquisitions to destroy shareholders' wealth. Unfortunately, most executives focus only on sales and profits going up, never realizing that they've put in motion a plan to destroy their company's true profitability--its return on invested capital. M&A, like other aspects of running a company, works best when seen as a way to create shareholder value through customers. Some deals are sought to help create better value propositions for the business or to better execute current strategies--or to block competitors from doing these things. But most deals are about customers and should start with an analysis of customer profitability. Some customers are deliciously profitable; others are dismal money losers. The better an acquirer understands the profitability of its own customers, the better positioned it will be to perform such analyses on other companies. In this article, the authors show that customer profitability varies far more dramatically than most managers suspect. They also describe how to measure the profitability of customers. By understanding the economics of customer profitability, companies can avoid making deals that hurt their shareholders, they can identify surprising deals that do create wealth, and they can salvage deals that would otherwise be losers."}

Genetic deficiency of vasopressin in rats, resulting from a null mutation of the vasopressin gene, causes alterations of brain development with resulting behavioral and neurochemical phenotypes in adulthood. We previously demonstrated that partial vasopressin deficiency (rats heterozygous for the null mutation) produces enhanced visuospatial attention and motor speeding. Here, the results of studies of homozygous Brattleboro rats that are fully vasopressin deficient are reported. We trained subjects to perform a lateralized reaction time task that measures visuospatial divided attention; in task conditions in which the duration of target stimuli was varied from trial to trial, homozygous Brattleboro rats showed a performance phenotype that consisted of more accurate responding for longer duration, and less accurate responding for briefer duration, target stimuli. No differences in response times were measured. Further experiments revealed that two separate processes produced this complex phenotype: a relatively slowed period of attentional engagement (resulting in compromised detection of fast onset-fast offset stimuli) that only partially masks a generally more accurate pattern of responding. These results, taken with earlier data, indicate that vasopressin plays a critical role in regulating visual attention and cognition, either directly, or via early alterations in neurodevelopment."}

Seventeen normal volunteers were subjected to three standard measurements namely flash ERGs under photopic and scotopic conditions and the transient pattern ERG (PERG). Each test followed the guidelines set by the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV). It was found that the mean values of the flash ERG a and b wave amplitudes and the PERG P50 and N95 amplitudes from the gold foil electrodes were approximately a factor of two larger than those from the H-K loop. In addition most of the subjects (13/17) felt less discomfort with the gold foil electrodes. We reached the conclusion that gold foil electrodes are the electrode of choice because they provide good patient comfort, reasonably high amplitudes and relatively reproducible results."}

In November 1995, we introduced a renal and cardiovascular treatment program into the Tiwi community, which has a three- to fivefold increase in death rates and a recent annual incidence of treated end-stage renal disease (ESRD) of 2760 per million. Our previous study described an estimated 50% reduction in renal failure and all-cause natural deaths in the treatment group through December 31, 1998. We now describe a reduction in these events through mid 2000. People eligible for treatment were those with confirmed hypertension, diabetics with microalbuminuria or overt albuminuria, and people with overt albuminuria, regardless of blood pressure and diabetes. Treatment centered around the use of perindopril (Coversyl, Servier), with additional agents as needed to reach defined blood pressure goals, attempts at control of glucose and lipid levels, and health education. Two hundred and sixty-seven people, or 30% of the adult population, have been enrolled, with mean follow up of 3.39 years. Rates of terminal endpoints were compared on an intention-to-treat basis with those of 327 historical controls matched for baseline disease severity, who were followed for a mean of 3.18 years in the pre-treatment program era, against a background of no treatment or inconsistent changing treatment. Terminal events occurred in 38 controls and 23 people in the treatment group. The estimated rate of natural deaths in the treatment group was 50% that of the controls, (P=0.012); the rate of renal deaths was 47% (P=0.038) and the rate of non-renal deaths was 54% that of controls (P=0.085). Survival benefit in the treatment group was observed at all levels of overt albuminuria, in non-diabetics and diabetics, in normotensive as well as hypertensive people, and in people who had been taking angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACEi) in the pre-program era, as well as those who had not. Benefit was absent among the low death rates of people without overt albuminuria, and questionable among people with glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) <60 mL/min. The number of people needed to treat (NNT) to avoid one terminal event of natural causes was calculated at only 11.6. Falling rates of deaths and renal failure in the whole community support marked benefit of the program. Millions of dollars have been saved, based on avoidance of dialysis alone, but the reduction in premature death is the greater benefit. Chronic disease programs like this are enormously effective, and should be introduced into to all high-risk communities as a matter of urgency."}

Eleven of the children had the severe form of spinal muscular atrophy (type I) and 11 children had the intermediate form (type II). The results of visual evoked potentials, brainstem evoked responses, and somatosensory evoked potentials were compared with those obtained in a control group. Statistical analysis showed abnormalities in the different sensory modalities. A significant increase in the visual evoked potential latencies was observed and was found more often in patients with spinal muscular atrophy type I. Alterations of the somatosensory thalamocortical responses were also observed, as well as a delay in the central conduction time. Although spinal muscular atrophy is usually considered to be a purely motor disorder involving neurons of the spinal anterior horn and nuclei of the lower cranial nerves, lesions of the posterior roots, spinal ganglia, ascending tracts, lateral geniculated corpus, and thalamus have been reported. Our results suggest that sensory neuron degeneration occurs more commonly in spinal muscular atrophy than previously thought and that this process probably develops more slowly than motoneuron degeneration. Such degeneration may be associated with brain atrophy."}

These findings indicate that NGF might be implicated in the regulation of the antigen expressed by oligodendrocyte progenitors (NG2) and of the neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56/NCAM). Both antigens are associated with mechanisms of brain repair thus providing additional evidence for a major role of NGF in the brain response to pathological conditions such as EAE.

Recently, a high habitual intake of caffeine was found associated with better verbal memory performance and psychomotor speed in several cross-sectional population studies. We tested the hypothesis that habitual caffeine intake can reduce or postpone age-related cognitive decline in healthy adults. For this purpose, the cognitive performance of all participants in the Maastricht Aging Study (MAAS), aged between 24 and 81 years, was reassessed after 6 years. Information on the intake of caffeine-containing beverages was available from the baseline questionnaire. After 6 years, 1376 (75.6%) individuals were available for reassessment. After correction for demographic characteristics, baseline performance and health status, there were small albeit significant associations between the overall estimated caffeine intake at baseline and the 6-year change in complex motor speed (motor choice reaction time). The earlier found association between caffeine intake and verbal memory performance was not apparent in this longitudinal study. These results imply that the longitudinal effect of habitual caffeine intake is limited and will not promote a substantial reduction in age-related cognitive decline at a population level."}

Subsequently, the trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), ultraviolet absorbance to dissolved organic carbon (UV:DOC) ratio, and molecular size distribution of the DOM, AHS and hydrophilic fractions (HiF) (HiF=HiA+BaS+HiN) were examined. The THMFP of HiF, normalized on a DOC basis, was found to be comparable to that of AHS (0.176 microM THM mg C(-1) vs. 0.195 microM THM mg C(-1), respectively). The importance of HiF over AHS as a THM precursor became more pronounced when THMFP was evaluated in terms of concentration. In this case, the THMFP of HiF was much greater than that of AHS (0.374 microM THM l(-1) vs. 0.229 microM THM l(-1), respectively). Molecular size distributions all exhibited a narrow size range and relatively low molecular weights. The weight-averaged molecular weights of DOM, AHS and HiF were 780, 957 and 606 g M(-1), respectively."}

In this study, human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) exposed to hypoxia in vitro demonstrated a non-lethal but dysfunctional phenotype, closely reflective of the epithelial pathobiology of ARF. HK-2 cells exposed to hypoxia demonstrated increased paracellular permeability, decreased proliferation, loss of tight junctional integrity, and significant actin disassembly in the absence of cell death. Microarray analysis of transcriptomic changes underlying this response identified a distinct cohort of 48 genes with a closely shared hypoxia-dependent expression profile. Within this hypoxia-sensitive cluster were genes identified previously as hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)-dependent (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor and adrenomedullin) as well as genes not previously known to be hypoxia-responsive (e.g. stanniocalcin 2). In hypoxia, HIF-1 bound to evolutionarily conserved hypoxia-response elements (HRE) in the promoters of these genes as well as to the HRE consensus motif. A further subset of these genes, not associated with transcriptional regulation by HIF-1, was also present, suggesting alternative HIF-1-independent pathways. Overexpression of HIF-1 alpha in normoxia induced the expression of a significant number of the hypoxia-dependent genes; however, it did not induce the pathophysiologic epithelial response. In summary, hypoxia-elicited alterations in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in vitro closely resemble the epithelial pathophysiology of ARF. Our data indicate that although this event may rely heavily on HIF-1-dependent gene transcription, it is likely that separate hypoxia-dependent transcriptional regulators also play a role."}

We investigated whether skeletal muscle Ca2+ and K+ regulation might be abnormal in eight LTx and eight healthy controls. Peak oxygen consumption and arterialized venous plasma [K+] (where brackets denote concentration) were measured during incremental exercise. Vastus lateralis muscle was biopsied at rest and analyzed for sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, Ca2+ uptake, and Ca2+-ATPase activity rates; fiber composition; Na+-K+-ATPase (K+-stimulated 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphatase) activity and content ([3H]ouabain binding sites); as well as for [H+] and H+-buffering capacity. Peak oxygen consumption was 47% less in LTx (P < 0.05). LTx had lower Ca2+ release (34%), Ca2+ uptake (31%), and Ca2+-ATPase activity (25%) than controls (P < 0.05), despite their higher type II fiber proportion (LTx, 75.0 +/- 5.8%; controls, 43.5 +/- 2.1%). Muscle [H+] was elevated in LTx (P < 0.01), but buffering capacity was similar to controls. Muscle 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphatase activity was 31% higher in LTx (P < 0.05), but [3H]ouabain binding content did not differ significantly. However, during exercise, the rise in plasma [K+]-to-work ratio was 2.6-fold greater in LTx (P < 0.05), indicating impaired K+ regulation. Thus grossly subnormal muscle calcium regulation, with impaired potassium regulation, may contribute to poor muscular performance in LTx."}

Both stents are advanced at the site of the bifurcation. The proximal marker of the side-branch stent must be situated in the main branch at a distance of 4-5 mm proximal to the carina of the bifurcation and the main branch stent must cover the bifurcation as well as the protruding segment of the side-branch stent. The side-branch stent is deployed first and balloon and wire are removed. The stent deployed in the main branch completely covers and crushes the protruding segment of the side branch stent against the vessel wall of the main branch. Following main- and side-branch predilatation, stents were successfully deployed in all lesions. Final kissing balloon inflation was performed in seven patients. Two patients had in-hospital myocardial infarction and one patient underwent in-hospital re-PTCA due to a dissection distal to a stent. No other major adverse cardiac events were observed in-hospital and during 1-month clinical follow-up. Treatment of bifurcation lesions using crushing stent technique is feasible with acceptable rate of procedural complications. Angiographic follow-up is necessary to prove the advantage of this specific technique to give complete coverage of the ostium of the side branch with a drug-eluting stent."}

A total of 503 isolates were examined for susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, and resistant isolates were examined for the presence of selected resistance genes by PCR. Only 48 (9.5%) of the isolates were resistant to one or more of the antimicrobial agents tested. A low frequency of resistance was found towards ampicillin (1.8%), chloramphenicol (1.6%), florphenicol (0.4%), nalidixic acid (1.6%), neomycin (0.6%), streptomycin (4.4%), sulfamethoxazole (4.2%), tetracycline (4.0%) and trimethoprim (1.4%), whereas all isolates were susceptible to co-amoxiclav, ceftiofur, ciprofloxacin, colistin and gentamicin. All nine ampicillin-resistant isolates contained a sequence similar to the blaTEM-1b gene, one of the eight chloramphenicol-resistant isolates a sequence similar to the catA1 gene, all three neomycin-resistant isolates a sequence similar to the aphA-2 gene, 16 (73%) of the 22 streptomycin-resistant isolates a sequence similar to the aadA gene, the remaining six (27%) a sequence similar to the strA gene, and all 21 sulfamethoxazole-resistant isolates a sequence similar to the sul2 gene. Thirteen (65%) of the 20 tetracycline-resistant isolates contained the tet(A) gene, four (20%) the tet(B) gene, and one (5%) the tet(C) gene. This study showed a low frequency of resistance among Salmonella Weltevreden isolated from humans and other reservoirs in South-East Asia and elsewhere.

Averaged auditory (click-train) evoked potentials were recorded from multicontact subdural recording arrays chronically implanted over the lateral surface of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) and from modified depth electrodes inserted into HG. Biphasic electrical pulses (bipolar, constant current, 0.2 ms) were delivered to HG sites while recording from the electrode array over acoustically responsive STG cortex. Stimulation of sites along the mediolateral extent of HG resulted in complex waveforms distributed over posterolateral STG. These areas overlapped each other and field PLST. For any given HG stimulus site, the morphology of the electrically evoked waveform varied across the STG map. A characteristic waveform was recorded at the site of maximal amplitude of response to stimulation of mesial HG [presumed primary auditory field (AI)]. Latency measurements suggest that the earliest evoked wave resulted from activation of connections within the cortex. Waveforms changed with changes in rate of electrical HG stimulation or with shifts in the HG stimulus site. Data suggest widespread convergence and divergence of input from HG to posterior STG. Evidence is presented for a reciprocal functional projection, from posterolateral STG to HG. Results indicate that in humans there is a processing stream from AI on mesial HG to an associational auditory field (PLST) on the lateral surface of the superior temporal gyrus."}

Compound 1 stimulated glucose uptake and potentiated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. When cells were treated with various concentrations of insulin in the presence of compound 1, marked enhancement of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was observed at each concentration, suggesting that the compound might function as an insulin sensitizer. Preliminary study on the structure-activity relationships revealed that two aromatic benzene rings tolerated several substituents, but substitution by acidic or highly polar groups abolished the activity. Among several chalcone derivatives, 4-chloro-2'-benzyloxychalcone (compound 8) showed the highest level of activity. Compound 8-stimulated glucose uptake was almost completely inhibited by wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). These results suggest that the action of chalcone derivatives is mediated via a pathway involving PI3K."}

The aim of the present study was to define the active fragment in beta-conglycinin by using synthetic peptides chosen from the sequence of three beta-conglycinin subunits. We selected the fragments that had multiple nonadjacent arginine residues, and investigated their ability to bind to components of the rat intestinal brush border membrane as well as to stimulate CCK release and appetite suppression. The fragment from 51 to 63 of the beta subunit (beta 51-63) had the strongest binding activity. Intraduodenal infusion of beta 51-63 inhibited food intake and markedly increased portal CCK concentration. The threshold concentration of beta 51-63 to affect food intake was 3 micro mol/L. The CCK-A receptor antagonist abolished the beta 51-63-induced suppression of food intake. Three types of smaller fragments of beta 51-63 (beta 51-59, beta 53-63 and beta 53-59) and two types of fragments similar to beta 51-63 in the beta-conglycinin alpha and alpha' subunits (alpha 212-224 and alpha' 230-240) had less binding ability than did beta 51-63. Model peptides constructed with arginine (R) and glycine (G), such as GRGRGRG, had strong binding affinity, but peptides containing a single R or RR did not. These results indicate that the beta-conglycinin beta 51-63 fragment is the bioactive appetite suppressant in beta-conglycinin, and multiple arginine residues in the fragment may be involved in this effect."}

Findings with benign and malignant epidermal growths and with mammary carcinomas.", "abstract": "A procedure analogous to the plating of bacteria is described whereby some complex tumors have been taken apart and their components separately propagated. It was the outcome of finding that the forcible injection of Locke's solution followed by air can be used to split the subcutaneous connective tissue of sucklings and weanlings horizontally over the entire expanse of their backs or bellies, without inducing any complicating inflammation. Tumor fragments suspended in Locke's were widely scattered on the surfaces thus exposed. Most of them remained where they had lodged on the body wall, and rapidly becoming fixed in place, formed growths protected by the overlying cutaneous layer-which, throughout many weeks, remained unattached either to the wall or to them. The procedure is more searching in its disclosure of tumor constituents than those currently employed, and it has the advantage that it preserves the neoplastic components that it reveals. It has been used thus far only to rescue for experimental purposes transplantable, benign, epidermal papillomas from the hidden carcinomas deriving from their cells, and to set free and maintain the neoplastic components of complex mammary tumors of milk factor type. Success was obtained with such of the latter as were chosen for separate propagation, though successive platings were sometimes required for their isolation. Incidentally the procedure revealed two components in the mammary growths which could not have been discerned by previous methods of search. Each formed tumors peculiar to itself."}

In an effort to integrate paclitaxel and topotecan into the treatment of limited disease (LD) SCLC, we conducted a Phase I study of these agents administered as initial induction therapy. Escalating doses of topotecan (0.8-1.4 mg/m(2) d1-5) and paclitaxel (110-175 mg/m(2) d1) were administered i.v. every 21 days for two cycles to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in patients with LD SCLC. This was followed by two cycles of etoposide (120 mg/m(2) d1-3) and cisplatin (60 mg/m(2) d1) with thoracic radiotherapy. The first 5 subjects received 1.8 Gy once daily x 25 fractions, while subsequent subjects received 1.5 Gy twice daily x 30 fractions. Two additional cycles of chemotherapy (topotecan and paclitaxel, followed by etoposide and cisplatin) were given. Common toxicities included grade >/=3 neutropenia in 67% of courses of topotecan and paclitaxel and grade >/=2 esophagitis in 71% of patients. The MTD was based on toxicity during the first two cycles of chemotherapy and defined after accrual of 18 patients to four dose levels. Two of three patients developed grade 3 nonhematological toxicity (pneumonia) at the fourth dose level. Thus, the third dose level (topotecan 1.2 mg/m(2), paclitaxel 160 mg/m(2)) was defined as the MTD recommended for Phase II studies. One subject died suddenly on day 2 of cycle 1 without autopsy confirmation of the etiology. A second subject died during cycle 3 due to thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and respiratory failure. Response rates after induction of topotecan and paclitaxel: 16 of 18 (88.8%) partial response, 1 of 18 (5.5%) complete response. Response rates after completion of therapy: 10 of 18 (55.5%) partial response, 7 of 18 (38.8%) complete response. Induction topotecan and paclitaxel before chemoradiotherapy in patients with LD SCLC is feasible and results in expected toxicities. The outcome of a recently closed Cancer and Leukemia Group B Phase II study of similar design (CLB-39808) should help determine whether or not this approach warrants testing in a randomized setting."}

Renograms (n=5800) were generated by convolving 10 real input functions with 580 artificially created retention functions. Their ratios of minimal to mean transit time ranged from 0.1 to 1.0, and for mean transit time ranged from 3 to 60 min. The retention function was recovered from each renogram and its associated input function by calculating the first derivative of the residence time of the tracer in the kidney. Minimal, mean, and maximal transit time of the recovered retention function were calculated and compared with the original values. Qualitatively, the recovered retention function differed little from the original one. Quantitatively, values for recovered minimal transit time equalled original minimal transit time in all cases, whilst recovered mean transit time and maximal transit time equalled, respectively, the original mean transit time and maximal transit time if the original minimal to mean transit time ratio equalled 1. If this ratio was less than 1, recovered mean transit time was higher than original mean transit time and recovered maximal transit time was lower than original maximal transit time. For values of mean and maximal transit time, the differences from the original value increased with increasing original mean and maximal transit time, respectively, and with increasing renal clearance and decreasing minimal to mean transit time ratio. It is confirmed that Rutland's method is a particularly interesting alternative to deconvolution analysis. The errors that occur when recovering the retention function are relatively small."}

The frequency of rectal cancer in this population, surgical intervention, general outcomes and cancer recurrence are described. Data on 1850 patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy from 1983 to 2001 were reviewed. Information was gathered from data in the department's pelvic pouch database, as well as pathology and surgical reports. Follow-up questionnaires routinely sent to patients as part of the database were included in the analysis to determine current functional status. Mean follow-up period was 7.5 years after surgery. Seventy patients had coexisting colorectal cancer at time of IPAA. 7 (10%) of cancers were incidental. Pre-operative duration of disease was 18.6 years. Twenty-six of the cancers were rectal cancers. The most common form of anastomosis in the rectal cancers was mucosectomy, especially in pre-operatively known rectal cancer or low lying dysplasia. Preferred surgical technique for rectal cancer in mucosal ulcerative colitis (UC) included high ligation of mesenteric vessels with radical colectomy and taped occlusion of the rectum with irrigation of the rectal stump with Turnbull solution prior to mucosectomy. Patients with Stage 3 cancers received postoperative chemotherapy. Post-operative radiation therapy was not commonly recommended. Five of 70 patients were deceased from metastatic colon cancer; 55 patients were confirmed alive with good to excellent pouch function with a follow-up range of 1-17 years. Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis is a successful surgical approach for patients with coexisting colorectal cancer in UC. When the appropriate surgical technique is used in patients with colon or rectal cancer, along with adjuvant chemotherapy when appropriate, prognosis and function is very good."}

One patient was withdrawn from the study due to gastrointestinal side effects. Of the 11 remaining patients, cyclosporine or tacrolimus was completely withdrawn in five patients. Two patients developed suspected acute rejection episodes that were controlled by increasing the tacrolimus dosage. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1C and C-peptide levels were significantly lower at 3 and 6 months after the initiation of mycophenolate mofetil (P<.03 in all cases). Furthermore, urea and uric acid levels were significantly reduced after the change of treatment. In conclusion, a switch from cyclosporine/tacrolimus to mycophenolate mofetil may produce beneficial metabolic effects in diabetic liver transplant recipients, but poses a risk of graft rejection."}

Their paranoid-schizoid anxiety is more a combination of dread, paranoia, and fear of destroying one's object with neediness, envy, and other oral desires. In this part-self and part-object world, destruction is absolute. Ego functions and object relational capacities such as guilt and grief are not yet fully consolidated. The part-object is not only destroyed but is also equally capable of magically resurrecting itself to seek revenge. Fear of annihilation of the self and object, as well as desperate attempts at keeping each other alive, are the primary focus of this early anxiety state. These infantile fears are at the root of certain difficult treatment situations. Within the transition from paranoid-schizoid to depressive, the ego struggles with highly exaggerated and distorted fantasies of persecution, loss, and primitive guilt by resorting to crude and often self-destructive mechanisms. These include splitting, projective identification, and idealization. During the course of analytic treatment, three overlapping phases are distinguishable. Acting out is the main theme of early treatment. As this externalization of internal conflict is analyzed and contained, a second phase of intrapsychic struggle emerges. The patient exhibits a paralyzing battle between certain ego-object ties and the striving of a defensive death instinct. If the analytic relationship is able to withstand passage through these difficult phases, the patient begins to work through more core issues of persecutory loss and annihilation. Case material is used for illustration."}

An interactive model of factors likely to influence the balance between the supply and demand of endocrinologists during the next 20 years was constructed. The model used data from a wide range of sources and was developed under the guidance of a panel of experts derived from sponsoring organizations of endocrinologists. We determined current and projected numbers and demographics of endocrinologists in the U.S. workforce and the anticipated balance between supply and demand from 1999 to 2020. There were 3,623 adult endocrinologists in the workforce in 1999, of whom 2,389 (66%) were in office-based practice. Their median age was 49 years. Both total office visits and services performed by endocrinologists (particularly for diabetes) increased substantially during the 1990s. Waiting time for an initial appointment is presently longer for endocrinologists than for other physicians. Compared with a balanced, largely closed-staff health maintenance organization, the current national supply of endocrinologists is estimated to be 12% lower than demand. The number of endocrinologists entering the market has continuously fallen over the previous 5 years, from 200 in 1995 to 171 in 1999. Even if this downward trend were abruptly stopped, the model predicts that demand will exceed supply from now until 2020. While this gap narrows from 2000 to 2008 due to projected growth of managed care, it widens thereafter due to the aging of both the population and the endocrine workforce. Inclusion of other factors such as projected real income growth and increased prevalence of age-related endocrine disorders (e.g., diabetes and osteoporosis) further accentuates the deficit. If the number of endocrinologists entering the workforce remains at 1999 levels, demand will continue to exceed supply from now through 2020 for adult endocrinologists, and the gap will widen progressively from 2010 onward. The present analysis indicates that the number of endocrinologists entering the workforce will not be sufficient to meet future demand. These data suggest that steps should be taken to stop the ongoing decline in the number of endocrinologists in training and consideration should be given to actions designed to increase the number of endocrinologists in practice in the years ahead."}

We generated two lines of transgenic mice termed Tet and TeNT mice and crossed the two transgenic lines to produce the Tet/TeNT double transgenic mice. In the Tet mice, the tetracycline-controlled reverse activator (rtTA) was expressed selectively in cerebellar granule cells by the promoter function of the GABA(A) receptor alpha6 subunit gene. In the TeNT mice, the fusion gene of tetanus neurotoxin light chain (TeNT) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was designed to be induced by the interaction of doxycycline (DOX)-activated rtTA with the tetracycline-responsive promoter. The Tet/TeNT mice grew normally even after DOX treatment and exhibited a restricted DOX-dependent expression of TeNT in cerebellar granule cells. Along with this expression, TeNT proteolytically cleaved the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2 (also termed synaptobrevin2) and reduced glutamate release from granule cells. Both cleavage of VAMP2/synaptobrevin2 and reduction of glutamate release were reversed by removal of DOX. Among the four genotypes generated by heterozygous crossing of Tet and TeNT mice, only Tet/TeNT mice showed DOX-dependent reversible motor impairments as analyzed with fixed bar and rota-rod tests. Reversible suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission thus can be manipulated with spatiotemporal accuracy by DOX treatment and removal. These transgenic mice will serve as an animal model to study the cerebellar function in motor coordination and learning."}

Postal questionnaire, survey on retrospective data. A questionnaire was sent to all ( n=63) ICUs with six or more beds suitable for mechanical ventilation and officially recognized by The Netherlands Intensive Care Society. Pediatric ICUs were excluded. There was an 87% ( n=55) response rate of contacted ICUs. The number of tracheostomies per year per unit varied widely (range 1-75), most ICUs (42%) performing between 11 and 25 tracheostomies per year. In 44% of ICUs ( n=24) tracheostomy was not performed on a routine basis. In 25% of ICUs ( n=14) tracheostomies were performed during the second week of ventilation. Surgical tracheostomy and percutaneous procedures were technique of first choice in 38% and 62% of ICUs, respectively. In only 7% of units were late follow-up protocols in use. Thirty-two units (58%) reported a total of 56 major complications. Timing and technique of tracheostomy varies widely in Dutch ICUs. The percutaneous technique is the procedure of choice for tracheostomy in most of these units. Late follow-up protocols are rarely in use."}

To some extent, IL-8 may derive from bronchial epithelial cells since airway epithelium plays a crucial role in initiating and augmenting host defense mechanisms. We hypothesized that a marked increase in bronchoepithelial IL-8 expression and release may be found in the airway epithelium of COPD patients compared to 'healthy' smokers and never-smokers. Primary bronchoepithelial cell cultures from COPD patients, smokers, and never-smokers were established. The unstimulated and TNFalpha-induced IL-8 release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In addition, mRNA expression levels were quantified by means of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and light cycler measurements. In subjects with COPD the constitutive and stimulated IL-8 release was significantly higher compared to 'healthy' smokers and control subjects, whereas no differences were seen between smokers and the control group. Quantitative assessment of transcript levels confirmed these data, displaying significantly higher mRNA levels in primary bronchial epithelial cells from COPD patients compared to controls (p < 0.05) in uninduced and stimulated conditions (p < 0.05). These results suggest that patients with chronic obstructive airflow limitation are characterized by a significant upregulation of bronchial epithelial IL-8 expression levels and secretion, indicating specific differences in epithelial cell activation in COPD patients compared to smokers and control subjects."}

This study was designed as a retrospective chart review of females treated for pouch-vaginal fistulas from 1983 to 2000. All patients were followed up using our prospective pouch registry, with additional data collected by interview or mailed questionnaire. Sixty females were identified (mean age, 33.3 +/- 1.3 years), of whom 33 had their initial restorative proctocolectomy done at our institution. Preoperative diagnosis was ulcerative colitis (88 percent), indeterminate colitis (10 percent), and familial adenomatous polyposis (2 percent). Average time to pouch-vaginal fistula following restorative proctocolectomy was 21 months (range, 1-132 months). Postoperative pelvic sepsis had occurred in 17 (28 percent) patients. Primary treatment modalities included the following: local repairs (n = 46, 77 percent), the majority of which were ileal advancement flaps; redo restorative proctocolectomy (n = 6, 10 percent); and pouch excision (n = 5, 8 percent). Initial healing was achieved in 20 patients. An additional 11 patients with recurrences healed after repeat procedures. The overall healing rate was 52 percent at 49.4 +/- 3.8 months follow-up. Pouch failure was the eventual outcome in 13 (22 percent) patients and 16 (27 percent) patients had persistent pouch-vaginal fistula. A delayed diagnosis of Crohn's disease was made in 24 patients. Crohn's disease patients had lower success rates following ileal advancement flaps compared with the non-Crohn's group (25 vs. 48 percent, respectively), much lower overall healing rates of their pouch-vaginal fistulas (17 vs. 75 percent, respectively), and a higher incidence of pouch failure (33 vs. 14 percent, respectively). Pouch-vaginal fistulas are a difficult problem in females following restorative proctocolectomy. However, local repair can be successful with good functional outcomes. Redo restorative proctocolectomy may also achieve healing if local repairs are not possible or have failed. A delayed diagnosis of Crohn's disease results in worse treatment outcome and higher pouch failure rates."}

We sequenced the promoter region of the RHCE gene, and compared our results with the reported sequence. Genomic DNA was prepared from blood samples collected from 656 Japanese donors. The DNA segment encompassing the promoter region and exon 1 of the RHCE gene from 30 donors was amplified by PCR and analyzed by DNA sequencing. Four nucleotide differences between RHC/c and RHD were found at positions -468, -304, -58, and -46. On the basis of the nucleotide differences at positions -468 (RHCE vs. RHD) and -292 (RHC vs. RHc), we then developed a novel polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method for RHC/c genotyping. Analysis of the genomic DNA from the 656 donors revealed that this method could discriminate RHC from RHc, irrespective of the RHD genotype, with only a few exceptions. The combination of our system and the intron 2-based PCR-RFLP method previously reported may prove to be more accurate than either of the methods alone, and therefore, useful and valuable for RHC/c genotyping."}

Heparanase association with clinicopathological features related to prognostic significance was examined in patients presenting with invasive cervical cancer. Gene expression of heparanase was assessed by RT-PCR in 10 normal cervix and 92 invasive cervical cancer samples. Heparanase mRNA expression was not detected in any of the normal cervix specimens, but was significantly higher in advanced-stage tumors (P = 0.026). In cases treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, heparanase mRNA expression was significantly higher in tumors exhibiting lymph-vascular space invasion (P = 0.01). A significant relationship was found between microvessel counts and heparanase mRNA expression (P = 0.035). The disease-free and overall survival rates of patients exhibiting heparanase mRNA expression were significantly lower than those of patients lacking heparanase mRNA expression (P = 0.019 and 0.017, respectively). Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that heparanase mRNA expression was an independent prognostic factor for both disease-free and overall survival. These findings provide evidence that heparanase expression can serve as an indicator of aggressive potential and poor prognosis in cervical cancer. Consequently, heparanase inhibitor will be a novel candidate for therapeutic intervention in this disease."}

Prevention of graft rejection with immunosuppressive therapy is then necessary. Topical corticosteroids are currently the gold standard, and steroids are the only treatment for acute rejection episodes. Steroids are nonspecific immunosuppressive agents, and they can induce glaucoma, cataract, infections, and epithelial defects. Cyclosporin has a specific effect, because it inhibits interleukin-2 transcription and, consequently, the specific activation of T lymphocytes. When cyclosporin is given orally, it effectively prevents graft rejection in high-risk recipients, but it may induce severe side effects (i.e., systemic hypertension, kidney deficiency, and malignant tumor induction). When cyclosporin is given topically, it can effectively replace steroids in case of dexamethasone-induced glaucoma and graft infection, but it can also induce serious corneal epithelial defects. Cyclosporin is not a treatment for acute rejection episodes. Mycophenolate mofetil and FK 506 are promising drugs, but currently they cannot be used routinely to prevent corneal graft rejection."}

Here we extend these observations to mouse brain. The prefrontal cortex expresses abundant 5- hydroxytryptamine2A receptors, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, Western blots and in situ hybridization procedures. The application of the 5-hydroxytryptamine2A/2C agonist DOI (100 microm) by reverse dialysis in the medial prefrontal cortex doubled the local release of 5-hydroxytryptamine. This effect was reversed by coperfusion of tetrodotoxin, and by the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor antagonist M100907, but not by the 5-hydroxytryptamine2C antagonist SB-242084. The effect of DOI was also reversed by prazosin (alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist), BAY x 3702 (5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor agonist), NBQX (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-4-propionate/kainic acid antagonist) and 1S,3S-ACPD (mGluR II/III agonist), but not by dizocilpine (N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist). alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-4-propionate mimicked the 5-hydroxytryptamine elevation produced by DOI, an effect also reversed by BAY x 3702. Likewise, the coperfusion of classical (chlorpromazine, haloperidol) and atypical antipsychotic drugs (clozapine, olanzapine) fully reversed the 5-hydroxytryptamine elevation induced by DOI. These observations suggest that DOI increases 5-hydroxytryptamine release in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex through the activation of local 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptors by an impulse-dependent mechanism that involves/requires the activation of local alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-4-propionate receptors. This effect is reversed by ligands of receptors present in the medial prefrontal cortex, possibly in pyramidal neurons, which are involved in the action of antipsychotic drugs. In particular, the reversal by classical antipsychotics may involve blockade of alpha1-adrenoceptors, whereas that of atypical antipsychotics may involve 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptors and alpha1-adrenoceptors."}

These nonfusion systems intend to maintain or restore the intersegmental motions to magnitudes of the intact spine and have no negative effects on the segments adjacent to the stabilized one. This study investigated the DYNESYS, a dynamic nonfusion system, which is designed to stabilize the bridged segments while maintaining the disc and the facet joints. To determine the magnitude of stabilization and the effect of the stabilization on the adjacent segment, six lumbar cadaver spines were fixed in a spine tester and loaded with pure moments in the three main motion planes. For each spine, four different stages were tested: intact, defect of the middle segment, fixation with the DYNESYS, and fixation with the internal fixator. Intersegmental motions were measured at all levels. For the bridged segment, the DYNESYS stabilized the spine and was more flexible than the internal fixator. This difference between the internal fixator and the DYNESYS was most pronounced in extension (P < 0.05), with the DYNESYS restoring the motion back to the level of the intact spine. The motion in the adjacent segments was not influenced by either stabilization method. Our results suggest that the DYNESYS provides substantial stability in case of degenerative spinal pathologies and can therefore be considered as an alternative method to fusion surgery in these indications while the motion segment is preserved."}

Therefore, this study systematically investigates several main problems, namely, the effect of sample preparation and some instrument-related parameters on the stability of the noncovalent complexes as well as the formation of nonspecific cluster ions in the case of the MALDI-MS analysis of specific peptide/peptide complexes. The complexes formed between biologically active fragments of human gastrin I, which contain the sequence motif EEEEE, and different peptides, which contain the interacting sequence motifs RR and RKR, were chosen as examples. A broad variety of MALDI matrices and sample preparation protocols were screened systematically and evaluated. The two 'less acidic' matrices 2,4,6-trihydroxyacetophenone and 6-aza-2-thiothymine, in combination with carefully selected solvents and additives, turned out to allow the reproducible detection of the solution-phase peptide/peptide complexes with good intensity, whereas the classical MALDI matrices could not be applied with the same success. Because both matrices also tend to induce the formation of nonspecific cluster ions, control experiments using nonbinding peptides were performed to definitely prove the specificity of the detected complexes. In contrast to the sensitivity of the peptide/peptide complexes to solution-phase conditions, the gas-phase stability during desorption/ionization was found to be extraordinary high. Neither the application of high laser fluence nor switching from continuous to delayed extraction mode as well as variation of the delay time up to 520 ns had considerable effect on the relative intensities of the specific peptide/peptide complexes."}

The inversion intervals are 16 and 22 cM in size together they cover approximately half of chromosome 4. Since recombination between the wild-type and inversion chromosomes does not occur within these inversion intervals, mutant alleles of genes mapping to this region can be identified and maintained. Therefore, these inversion chromosomes work as balancer chromosomes. These inversions have the additional advantage that they are tagged with genes encoding the visible coat color markers tyrosinase and agouti, and therefore the dosage of the inversion chromosome (+/+, Inv/+, Inv/Inv) can be visually recognized. These inversion strains will be extremely useful for mutagenesis screens that focus on functional annotation of human chromosome 1p."}

An analysis of the coefficients is given for loose membranes as well as for dense natural membranes where transport may go through capillaries or by solution in the lipoid parts of the membrane. Water diffusion and filtration and the relation between these and capillary pore radius of the membrane are discussed. For the permeation of ions through the charged membranes equations are developed for the case of zero electrical current in the membrane. The correlation of sigma with omega and L(p) for electrolytes resembles that for non-electrolytes. In this case omega and sigma depend markedly on ion concentration and on the charge density of the membrane. The reflection coefficient may assume negative values indicating anomalous osmosis. An analysis of the phenomena of anomalous osmosis was carried out for the model of Teorell and Meyer and Sievers and the results agree with the experimental data of Loeb and of Grim and Sollner. A set of equations and reference curves are presented for the evaluation of omega and sigma in the transport of polyvalent ions through charged membranes."}

We were also interested in exploring whether the source of the interference is due to child-internal crosslanguage contact between English and Spanish, as is commonly assumed, or due to the nature of the language input in a bilingual family, a factor which has not typically been considered in studies of crosslinguistic influence. The use of subjects in a null subject language like Spanish is a phenomenon linked to the pragmatics/syntax interface of the grammar, and thus, is a domain where crosslinguistic interference is predicted to be likely to occur in bilingual acquisition (Müller & Hulk, 2001). Using spontaneous language data available from CHILDES (www.childes.psy.cmu.edu), we examined the use of overt subjects in Spanish by two Spanish monolingual children (ages: 1;8-2;7 and 1;8-1;11) one Spanish-English bilingual child (age 1;9-2;6) and their parental interlocutors. We looked at the proportions of overt versus null subjects as well as the discourse-pragmatic contexts of overt subject use by the children in order to uncover bilingual/monolingual differences in the distributional properties and the functional determinants of subject realization. We also looked at identical variables in the speech of the children's parental interlocutors to investigate the potential influence of the input on the children's output. Our results suggest that the bilingual child showed patterns in her subject realizations in Spanish that could be interpreted as due to crosslinguistic effects from English; however, there is also evidence that these effects may have a source in the input, rather than resulting from internal crosslanguage contact. While our data do not permit us to distinguish conclusively between these two possible sources, they indicate that future research on crosslinguistic influence in bilingual acquisition should take input into account."}

Published United States reference data, however, provide estimates only of the median and lowest and highest 5th and 10th percentiles for birth weight at each gestational age. The purpose of our analysis was to create more continuous reference measures of birth weight for gestational age for use in epidemiologic analyses. We used data from the most recent nationwide United States Natality datasets to generate multiple reference percentiles of birth weight at each completed week of gestation from 22 through 44 weeks. Gestational age was determined from last menstrual period. We analyzed data from 6,690,717 singleton infants with recorded birth weight and sex born to United States resident mothers in 1999 and 2000. Birth weight rose with greater gestational age, with increasing slopes during the third trimester and a leveling off beyond 40 weeks. Boys had higher birth weights than girls, later born children higher weights than firstborns, and infants born to non-Hispanic white mothers higher birth weights than those born to non-Hispanic black mothers. These results correspond well with previously published estimates reporting limited percentiles. Our method provides comprehensive reference values of birth weight at 22 through 44 completed weeks of gestation, derived from broadly based nationwide data. Other approaches require assumptions of normality or of a functional relationship between gestational age and birth weight, which may not be appropriate. These data should prove useful for researchers investigating the predictors and outcomes of altered fetal growth."}

This organism is primarily a commensal in the upper respiratory tract of humans, but can cause pneumonia in high-risk persons and disseminate from the lungs by invasion of the bloodstream. Currently, prevention of pneumococcal infections is by immunization with vaccines which contain capsular polysaccharides from the most common serotypes causing invasive disease. However, there are more than 90 antigenically distinct serotypes and there is concern that serotypes not included in the vaccines may become more prevalent in the face of continued use of polysaccharide vaccines. Also, certain high-risk groups have poor immunological responses to some of the polysaccharides in the vaccine formulations. Protein antigens that are conserved across all capsular serotypes would induce more effective and durable humoral immune responses and could potentially protect against all clinically relevant pneumococcal capsular types.

In multivariate analysis, the factors mediator (TGF-beta1, IL-1alpha, IL-10), mediator concentration, methionine concentration, and \"mediator x concentration\" interaction independently influenced tHcy concentrations in culture supernatants. A 31% increase in tHcy was observed after exposure of huRPTECs to TGF-beta1 compared to medium alone. However, TGF-beta1 plasma levels in kidney graft recipients showed no independent association with tHcy plasma concentrations. We demonstrated that the release of Hcy from huRPTECs is enhanced by TGF-beta1, but that TGF-beta1 plasma levels in renal graft recipients show no independent relationship with hyperhomocysteinemia."}

Parkin protein is characterized by a ubiquitin-like domain at its NH(2) terminus and by two RING finger motifs and one IBR (in between RING finger) motif at its COOH-terminus (RING-IBR-RING). We showed that the parkin protein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which binds to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) through its RING-IBR-RING motif. The pathogenesis of AR-JP, therefore, was hypothesized to be accumulation of unidentified neurotoxic protein (a substrate of parkin). On the basis of this hypothesis, the substrate of parkin was sought using a yeast two-hybrid system. A putative G protein-coupled transmembrane polypeptide, named Pael (parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like) receptor, was identified as a parkin binding protein. When overexpressed in cells, this receptor tends to become unfolded, insoluble, and ubiquitinated. The insoluble Pael receptor leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced cell death. Parkin specifically ubiquitinates this receptor in the presence of ER-resident E2s and promotes the degradation of unfolded Pael receptor, resulting in suppression of the cell death induced by the accumulation of unfolded Pael receptor in the ER. Moreover, the insoluble form of Pael receptor accumulates in the brain of AR-JP patients. This protein is highly expressed in the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which is specifically affected in Parkinson's disease; although it is also widely expressed in oligodendroglias in the fiber tract.

After extirpation of practically all of the non-nervous structure, the sense organ's remains continue to function as a mechano-receptor, namely to produce generator and all-or-nothing potentials in response to mechanical stimuli. Compression of the first intracorpuscular node of Ranvier abolishes the production of \"all-or-nothing\" potentials in the corpuscle. Graded generator potentials constitute then the only response to mechanical stimulation. This reveals that the first node is the site of origin of the all-or-nothing potential and that the non-myelinated ending is incapable of producing all-or-nothing responses in response to mechanical stimulation. Compression of the entire length of non-myelinated ending suppresses the production of generator potentials. Partial compression of the ending abolishes mechano-responsiveness only of the compressed part. The intact remains of the ending continue to give generator potentials upon mechanical stimulation. This suggests that the generator potential arises at functionally independent membrane parts distributed all over the non-myelinated nerve ending. 24 to 36 hours after denervation of the corpuscle by transection of its sensory axon, no sign of electric activity is detected. Failure of mechano-reception at the nerve ending precedes that of conduction at the degenerating myelinated axon."}

Its diagnosis and treatment must be carried out promptly because of the possible serious complications that may occur through the clavicle compressing nearby structures. The authors report two cases, which were diagnosed by CT-scan. In the first case, treatment consisted in orthopedic reduction, while in the second case open reduction and fixation with Kirschner wires was required. The result was satisfactory in both cases, and the patients remain asymptomatic three and five years after trauma."}

This study used a random sample of the population aged 18-64 in a German area to make a quantitative estimation of the stages of change to quit smoking among current smokers who had at least one quit attempt (n = 1075). The rate of those who did not intend to stop smoking (precontemplators) was 76.4%, that of those who intended to quit during the next 6 months (contemplators) was 17.0%, and that of those who intended to quit during the next 4 weeks was 6.6%. The three groups did not differ according to gender or age. Of those who had at least 16 years of education, more were contemplators than were those with fewer years of education. Among those who had somatic complaints or nausea from smoking, who had their first cigarette within 1 h or less after awakening, and who had more quit attempts, more were in the contemplation or preparation stage. Nicotine dependence may add to contemplating about quitting. The precontemplation rate was substantially higher than in samples from nations or states which show a large amount of TC provisions."}

No epidemiological studies have been published assessing the modifying effect of iodine deficiency on radiation-induced thyroid cancer following the Chernobyl accident. A population sample of 3070 individuals (2590 ages 6-18, and 480 adults) from 75 settlements in the most highly contaminated regions of the Bryansk Oblast of Russia was identified and sampled for urinary iodine measurements in 1996, and iodine deficiency in each geopolitical unit (raion) was estimated. All cases of thyroid cancer were identified in those born 1968-1986 who were resident in the study area in May-June 1986 (34 histologically confirmed cases). The risk of thyroid cancer was examined in relation to population estimates of thyroid radiation dose and urinary iodine excretion level. The excess relative risk (ERR) of thyroid cancer was significantly associated with increasing thyroid radiation dose, and was inversely associated with urinary iodine excretion levels. There was a joint effect of radiation exposure and iodine deficiency. At 1 gray (Gy), the ERR in territories with severe iodine deficiency was approximately two times that in areas of normal iodine intake. These findings suggest that elimination of iodine deficiency in areas affected by Chernobyl may be important in reducing the effects of radiation exposure on the thyroid. If confirmed by studies based on individuals, they may have implications for the use of stable iodine in the case of population exposure to radioactive iodine."}

In this study, we used a third-generation self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector system based on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) to improve transduction efficiency and prevent vector-related toxicity. The transduction efficiency of the HIV-1-based vector was compared directly with the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) SIN vector in human leukemia cell lines. Initial transduction efficiencies were almost 100% for the HIV and less than 50% for the MLV vectors. Similar results were observed in 11 types of primary cells obtained from leukemia or myeloma patients. Transgene expression persisted for 8 weeks in cells transduced with the HIV vector, but declined with the MLV vector. In addition, resting peripheral blood lymphocytes and CD34(+) hematopoietic cells were transduced successfully with the HIV vector, but not with the MLV vector. Finally, we confirmed vector gene integration in almost all colony-forming cells transduced with the HIV vector, but not with the MLV vector. In conclusion, this lentiviral vector is an excellent gene transduction system for human blood cells because of its high gene transduction and host chromosome integration efficiency."}

The absolute neutrophil count reached a nadir of 47 cells/mm(3) during VPA use and returned to normal upon its discontinuation. VPA is considered to be a well-tolerated antiepileptic drug. While neutropenia has been reported, it has been mild and transient. This patient developed severe neutropenia during effective treatment with VPA, making her significantly susceptible to infection. The Naranjo probability scale indicates VPA as the probable cause of neutropenia in this case. This report of severe neutropenia caused by VPA emphasizes the importance of monitoring complete blood cell counts during therapy with this agent."}

In this study, 22 patients with bone tumors had proximal tibial segmental prosthetic replacement using direct reattachment of the patellar tendon to the prosthesis without the use of a muscle flap. Two of 19 patients required reoperation in the postoperative period for hematomas. Both were free of infection or other complications at 24 months mean followup. No other wound complications occurred despite initiation of chemotherapy 2 to 3 weeks after surgery in patients with high-grade malignant tumors (15 of 19). The mean followup was 38.6 months (range, 13-99 months). The patients ranged in age from 15 to 74 years (mean, 39 years). The range of motion achieved postoperatively showed a mean of 97 degrees (+/-16.3 degrees). All patients had full passive extension with a mean extensor lag of 7.5 degrees. The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 27.6 (+/- 2.0).

An unerupted premolar was identified on the DPR lying horizontally and located entirely below the inferior dental canal in the first and second molar region. The crown was distally orientated and was somewhat demineralised. As this unerupted tooth appeared to have an intimate relationship with the inferior dental canal, which in turn had a close relationship with the distal roots of the lower left first molar, this relationship was investigated further. Spiral tomography using Soredex's Scanora unit was used to obtain three contiguous 2 mm thick cross-sectional images of the area, which showed the separation of the inferior dental canal from both the first molar tooth above and the unerupted premolar. This case highlights the role of Scanora cross-sectional imaging in establishing accurately the relationship between teeth and the inferior dental canal and to document the unusual position of this unerupted tooth."}

Both AD and AA are considered to be multifactorial diseases; however, distinct immunologic abnormalities have been described that play a crucial role. There is growing evidence that immunoglobulin-E hypersecretion and activation of the predominantly T-helper-2 (TH2)-like T cell subset trigger allergic inflammatory processes and cause the disease to become chronic. In the present paper, data suggesting reduced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responsiveness in patients with AD and AA are summarized, and the potential etiologic significance of a hyporeactive HPA axis is discussed. We propose that because of defective HPA axis, immunoregulation under stressful conditions is ineffective in patients with atopic conditions, leading to aberrant immune responses and subsequent exacerbation of the disease. Further research into the role of the HPA axis in atopy may elucidate the cause of stress-induced exacerbation of atopic symptoms and may be of clinical relevance."}

Two of the three cases were performed in conjunction with anterior repair. All three patients required surgical release of the tape, which was located at the urethrovesical junction rather than midurethra. All three patients remained stress continent after tape release. One patient developed urge incontinence. Excessive tension, as well as tape migration toward the urethrovesical junction, may be the cause of prolonged urinary retention after the TVT procedure. Surgical release of the tape is an effective management approach to this complication."}

Site of action, Na+ dependence, and structure-activity relationship.", "abstract": "chi-Conopeptide MrIA (chi-MrIA) is a 13-residue peptide contained in the venom of the predatory marine snail Conus marmoreus that has been found to inhibit the norepinephrine transporter (NET). We investigated whether chi-MrIA targeted the other members of the monoamine transporter family and found no effect of the peptide (100 microM) on the activity of the dopamine transporter and the serotonin transporter, indicating a high specificity of action. The binding of the NET inhibitors, [3H]nisoxetine and [3H]mazindol, to the expressed rat and human NET was inhibited by chi-MrIA with the conopeptide displaying a slight preference toward the rat isoform. For both radioligands, saturation binding studies showed that the inhibition by chi-MrIA was competitive in nature. It has previously been demonstrated that chi-MrIA does not compete with norepinephrine, unlike classically described NET inhibitors such as nisoxetine and mazindol that do. This pattern of behavior implies that the binding site for chi-MrIA on the NET overlaps the antidepressant binding site and is wholly distinct from the substrate binding site. The inhibitory effect of chi-MrIA was found to be dependent on Na+ with the conopeptide becoming a less effective blocker of [3H]norepinephrine by the NET under the conditions of reduced extracellular Na+. In this respect, chi-MrIA is similar to the antidepressant inhibitors of the NET. The structure-activity relationship of chi-MrIA was investigated by alanine scanning. Four residues in the first cysteine-bracketed loop of chi-MrIA and a His in loop 2 played a dominant role in the interaction between chi-MrIA and the NET. H alpha chemical shift comparisons indicated that side-chain interactions at these key positions were structurally perturbed by the replacement of Gly-6. From these data, we present a model of the structure of chi-MrIA that shows the relative orientation of the key binding residues. This model provides a new molecular caliper for probing the structure of the NET."}

The addition of 2% dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and 1% Triton X-100 to 25 microM APM had no effect in all treatments. A final experiment with 6,658 embryos demonstrated that a 2-day treatment in liquid media supplemented with 50 microM APM was the most successful with respect to chromosome doubling-36.7% of the plants were diploid-but the survival rate was reduced to 52.5% of that of the non-treated control. A 2-day treatment in liquid medium supplemented with 25 microM APM or a 2-day treatment on solid medium with 50 microM APM resulted in the production of diploids at a frequency of 28.9% and 21.3%, respectively. These may represent alternative methods for chromosome doubling since compared to the untreated control these two treatments reduced the survival rate by only about 24%. Final ploidy and fertility of the large proportion of induced mixoploid plants (up to 30.3%) need to be evaluated in further studies."}

Analysis of Tradescantia tissues indicated that amounts of nuclear histone fell into approximate multiples of the gametic (egg or sperm) quantity except in dividing tissues, where amounts intermediate between multiples were found. In differentiated tissues of lily, corn, onion, and broad bean, histones occurred in constant amounts per nucleus, characteristic of the species, as was found also for DNA.

Bacteriol. 86:740-748. 1963.-By measuring the reduction of the dye triphenyl tetrazolium chloride to the insoluble red formazan, an analysis was made of the inhibition by phage K of the dehydrogenase capacity of populations of Staphylococcus aureus K(1), to determine to what extent this might be associated with the ability of phage K to sensitize the cells-a reaction characterized by the conversion of the cell wall to susceptibility to lysis by the staphylococcal enzyme, virolysin. Increasing multiplicities of phage progressively increased the fractions of sensitized cells and also caused increasing inhibition of the dehydrogenase activity of the populations. The dehydrogenase activities of the sensitized fractions were compared with those of the nonsensitized fractions. Over a wide range of phage-bacterium ratios, the dehydrogenase activities of the sensitized fractions were found to be lower than those of the nonsensitized fractions. Microscopically, this was reflected by the appearance of large numbers of cells with a reduced amount of visible formazan granules. When lysin was added to the phage-treated cells, lysis occurred mainly from cell fractions which possessed little or no tetrazolium-reducing capacity. The data indicated that sensitization by phage was accompanied by a marked decrease in cellular dehydrogenase activity but was not associated with a complete inhibition of these enzymes. A comparison was made between the dehydrogenases of phage-sensitized cells and cells found to be \"spontaneously\" sensitive to virolysin, i.e., lysed by the enzyme without any prior exposure to phage. Like phage-sensitized cells, the spontaneously sensitized staphylococci possessed low dehydrogenase activity and lacked the capacity to support phage synthesis. In tests of a given cell preparation, the dehydrogenase levels of the phage-sensitized fractions were found to be close to, or even lower than, the level of the spontaneously sensitized fraction, suggesting that in S. aureus K(1) the sensitized state is associated in some manner with a reduction of the dehydrogenase activity to a critical level. There is as yet no evidence for any direct causal relationship between sensitization and dehydrogenase inhibition."}

Ang II in MCF-7 cells induced: (a) the translocation from the cytosol to membrane and nucleus of atypical protein kinase C-zeta (PKC-zeta) but not of PKC-alpha, -delta, - epsilon and -eta; (b) the expression of c-fos mRNA and protein; (c) the phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). All these effects were due to the activation of the Ang II type I receptor (AT1) since they were blocked by the AT1 antagonist losartan. The Ang II-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was blocked by (a) high doses of staurosporine, inhibitor of PKC-zeta, and by a synthetic myristoylated peptide with sequences based on the endogenous PKC-zeta pseudosubstrate region (zeta-PS); (b) PD098059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (MAPKK/MEK); and, moreover, (c) the inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), LY294002 and wortmannin, thus indicating that PI3K may act upstream of ERK1/2. The Ang II-evoked c-fos induction was blocked only by high doses of staurosporine and by zeta-PS whilst PD098059, LY294002 and wortmannin were ineffective, thus indicating that c-fos induction is not due to ERK1/2 activity. When the epidermal growth factor-receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase activity was inhibited by the use of its inhibitor AG1478, Ang II was still able to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation and c-fos expression, therefore proving that the transactivation of EGFR was not required for these Ang II effects in MCF-7 cells. The previously reported proliferation of MCF-7 cells induced by Ang II was blocked by PD098059 and by wortmannin in a dose-dependent manner, thereby indicating that in MCF-7 cells the PI3K and ERK pathways mediate the mitogenic signalling of AT1. Our results suggest that in MCF-7 cells Ang II activates multiple signalling pathways involving PKC-zeta, PI3K and MAPK; of these pathways only PKC-zeta appears responsible for the induction of c-fos."}

This article examines the onset of disability in older adult Americans using three waves of the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) survey (1993, 1995, 1998; n=4228). We use medical/demographic factors (arthritis, heart disease, diabetes; age, gender, race/ethnicity, wealth), baseline characteristics (affect, cognition, health behaviors, medical insurance), and time-varying covariates (changes in chronic conditions and baseline characteristics) to predict the onset of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) disability, individually and in the aggregate, over time. We find the onset of ADL and IADL disability is a complex process, suggesting important roles for medical, demographic, social, psychological, and behavioral triggers, specifically negative affect, higher body weight, and by the lack of vigorous exercise. We also find that individual ADL and IADL impairments are predicted by a variety of different factors, suggesting that summary measures of disability may be masking a wealth of potentially useful interventions. In general, public health efforts in the area of controlling obesity and treating depressive symptoms should be supported."}

In 86% of the patients PH started during infancy, 71.5% were female (mean age 28.8 years). A few patients had others diseases and 42.5% had some associated dermatological lesions. In 47.9% of the patients there is family history of PH. 96.4% reported palmar hyperhidrosis, 80.7% plantar PH and 71.3% reported axillary PH, being less frequent in others regions of the body. The most frequent clinical founding associated is facial blushing in 60.3%, 52.3% heart palpitations, 48% muscle stress, 31.8% reported trembling of the hands and 30,8% headache. In reference to social embarrassesment, we observe that relations between friends and professional environment are the most problematic situation. PH is a pathologic condition starting in infancy, family history of PH is frequent and most patients have some associated dermatological lesions. Excessive sweating is especially common in palms but no exclusively of this region as it extends to others regions with the same intensity.

Caspase-1 activity is transiently increased during myoblast differentiation. Both calpain and caspase appear to be responsible for the fusion-associated membrane protein degradation. Caspase-1 has been implicated in the activation of proinflammatory cytokines, and in cell apoptosis. The involvement of caspase-1 in L8 myoblast fusion represents a novel function for this caspase in a non-apoptotic differentiation process, and points to cross-talk between the calpain and caspase systems in some differentiation processes."}

In this review, we summarize data regarding the activation potential of these cells. Provision of cognate CD4 T cell help to anti-dsDNA B cells in nonautoimmune mice not only drives their maturation and entry into the B cell follicle, but also leads to secretion of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies. Intriguingly, if T regulatory cells are provided along with T helper cells, the antibody response of anti-dsDNA B cells is diminished. We have also found that T-independent stimulation with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides leads to the proliferation and enhanced recovery of antidsDNA B cells in vitro. These data suggest that control of anti-dsDNA antibody production may rely on elements from both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system."}

Here, we compared the antiapoptotic effects of wild-type FLT3 (WtFLT3) and FLT3/ITD in terms of the regulation of Bcl-2 family members. In a murine myeloid cell line, 32D, interleukin-3 (IL-3) deprivation induced apoptosis following the down-regulation of Bcl-XL and the dephosphorylation of Bad. However, the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, Bak, and Mcl-1 were unchanged. In WtFLT3-transfected 32D (WtFLT3-32D) cells, FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation did not restore the down-regulation of Bcl-XL but maintained the phosphorylation of Bad. Combined treatment with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, dephosphorylated Bad and induced apoptosis in WtFLT3-32D cells stimulated with FL. Induction of nonphosphorylated Bad induced remarkable apoptosis. These findings suggest that the FL stimulation is associated with antiapoptosis through Bad phosphorylation. On the other hand, FLT3/ITD-transfected 32D (FLT3/ITD-32D) cells survived in an IL-3-or FL-deprived state. Furthermore, the dephosphorylation of Bad using LY294002 and PD98059 was insufficient for apoptosis, and the down-regulation of Bcl-XL using antisense treatment was needed to induce apoptosis. FLT3 kinase inhibitor, AG1296, alone not only dephosphorylated Bad but also down-regulated Bcl-XL, leading FLT3/ITD-32D cells into apoptosis. These findings suggest that the antiapoptotic pathways from FLT3/ITD are more divergent than those from WtFLT3 and may represent targets for drug discovery with the potential of inducing selective cell death of human leukemia cells."}

Reduced regional cerebral blood flow has been demonstrated in patients with depression and chronic fatigue, symptoms that are common in primary hyperparathyroidism. The aim of this study was to reveal possible changes in regional cerebral blood flow in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism before and after operative treatment. This was a prospective study of regional cerebral blood flow in 16 consecutive women of median age 72 (range 50-82) years using SPECT with (99m)Tc-labelled hexamethylpropylenamine-oxime. The measurements were performed before and 2, 4 and 12 months after parathyroidectomy. The Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) depression score was used as a parallel clinical test. Reduced (pathological) regional cerebral blood flow was seen before operation in 14 patients, 13 with a solitary adenoma and one with double adenoma. After surgery, this improved to normal values in 13, but was further reduced in one. In two patients with preoperative normal regional cerebral blood flow, both of whom were asymptomatic and had diffuse hyperplasia, a slight reduction was demonstrated. Eight patients had a pathological preoperative MADRS score, which normalized in seven after surgical treatment. The finding of reduced regional cerebral blood flow in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism followed by significant improvement after operation might influence the case for surgical treatment."}

It has been proposed that the scaffold of early generated cells in the ventral thalamus, internal capsule and preplate play a pivotal role in their deployment through sharp gene expression boundaries. These ideas were recently evaluated in various strains of mutant mice. In Tbr1, Gbx2, Pax6 KO both thalamic and corticofugal projections fail to traverse the striatocortical junction. In both Emx2 and Pax6 KO brains, the misrouted thalamic afferents are accompanied by displacements of the pioneering projections from the internal capsule. Regardless of their altered route, thalamic afferents in the reeler and L1 KO mice seem to be able to redistribute themselves on the cortical sheet and establish normal periphery-related representation in the somatosensory cortex. Early neural activity delivered through the thalamic projections is thought to be involved in the realignment process of thalamic axons at the time of their accumulation in the subplate layer. However, axonal growth and the early topographic arrangement of thalamocortical fiber pathways appear normal in the Snap25 KO, where action potential mediated synaptic vesicle release is disrupted. We therefore suggest that intercellular communication mediated by constitutive secretion of transmitters or growth factors might play a dominant role during early thalamocortical development."}

Polyvalent (cross-linking) and low-mutated IgM antibodies (less immunogenic) are believed to be the most effective weapons against cancer. The best sources for these types of antibodies are the cancer patients themselves. Using conventional hybridoma technology, not only are fully human monoclonal IgM antibodies isolated, but also new tumor-related targets can be identified using the same experimental approach. The resulting antibodies can be used directly for therapeutic purposes without further modulation and manipulation. This report describes five newly established human monoclonal IgM antibodies; antibody LM-1 that was isolated from a patient with lung cancer, antibodies PM-1 und PM-2 that were isolated from a patient with pancreatic cancer, and antibodies CM-1 and CM-2 which were isolated from a patient with colon carcinoma. The mainly germ-line encoded antibodies are specific for malignant tissues and show only restricted reactivity with healthy cells. When tested for in vitro functional activity, all five antibodies inhibit tumor cell proliferation of carcinoma cells by inducing apoptosis."}

Our data have indicated that neuroactive steroids, like for instance, progesterone, dihydroprogesterone, tetrahydroprogesterone, dihydrotestosterone and 3alpha-diol, stimulate both in vivo and in vitro (Schwann cell cultures), the expression of two important proteins of the myelin of peripheral nerves, the glycoprotein Po (Po) and the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22). It is important to highlight that the mechanisms by which neuroactive steroids exert their effects on the expression of Po and PMP22 involve different kind of receptors depending on the steroid and on the myelin protein considered. In particular, at least in culture of Schwann cells, the expression of Po seems to be under the control of PR, while that of PMP22 needs the GABA(A) receptor. Because Po and PMP22 play an important physiological role for the maintenance of the multilamellar structure of the myelin of the PNS, the present observations might suggest the utilization of neuroactive steroids as new therapeutically approaches for the rebuilding of the peripheral myelin."}

Recent published data support the hypothesis that trimetazidine selectively inhibits long-chain 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase (LC 3-KAT), thereby reducing fatty acid oxidation resulting in clinical benefit. The aim of this study was to assess whether trimetazidine and ranolazine, which may also act as a metabolic modulator, are specific inhibitors of LC 3-KAT. We have demonstrated that trimetazidine and ranolazine do not inhibit crude and purified rat heart or recombinant human LC 3-KAT by methods that both assess the ability of LC 3-KAT to turnover specific substrate, and LC 3-KAT activity as a functional component of intact cellular beta-oxidation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that trimetazidine does not inhibit any component of beta-oxidation in an isolated human cardiomyocyte cell line. Ranolazine, however, did demonstrate a partial inhibition of beta-oxidation in a dose-dependent manner (12% at 100 micromol/L and 30% at 300 micromol/L). Both trimetazidine (10 micromol/L) and ranolazine (20 micromol/L) improved the recovery of cardiac function after a period of no flow ischemia in the isolated working rat heart perfused with a buffer containing a relatively high concentration (1.2 mmol/L) of free fatty acid. In summary, both trimetazidine and ranolazine were able to improve ischemic cardiac function but inhibition of LC 3-KAT is not part of their mechanism of action.

SPECIFICITY OF PYROGENIC TOLERANCE AND THE ROLE OF HYPERSENSITIVITY IN PYROGENICITY, LETHALITY, AND SKIN REACTIVITY.", "abstract": "Evidence is presented suggesting that the apparent non-specificity of pyrogenic tolerance observed with Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins is due to related antigenic determinants associated with the macromolecular toxins. This is based on results obtained in rabbits from pyrogenic cross-tolerance tests with selected endotoxins. In these tests, purified endotoxins from Escherichia coli (COO8) and Chromobacterium violaceum (CV) gave results one might expect with non-reciprocal cross-reacting antigens in classical immune systems. Additional evidence for an immune mechanism in tolerance is suggested by the highly significant anamnestic response observed. Lipid A, a toxic derivative of the purified COO8 endotoxin, failed to induce pyrogenic tolerance against the parent toxin. These results are explained by assuming that endotoxins have two interdependent activities associated with different portions of the macromolecule; one is assumed to be responsible for the primary toxicity, and the other is involved in secondary toxicity. The latter is dependent on the hypersensitive state of the host. Additional evidence for the role of hypersensitivity in secondary toxicity is based on the observation that adult rabbits are highly sensitive to the pyrogenic, lethal, and skin-reacting activities of endotoxin in contrast to young animals which are more resistant to all of these attributes of toxicity. In adults, the host responses to pyrogenicity, lethality, and skin reactivity could be partially inhibited by the early exposure of the animals to massive doses of endotoxin equivalent to a LD(50). The pyrogenic tolerance shown in these animals was specific indicating that the inhibition of the hypersusceptibility to endotoxin involved an immunological mechanism. A mechanism of endotoxin tolerance is proposed and discussed based on the induction of specific antibodies capable of assisting the RES in the clearance and destruction of endotoxin. It is suggested that the present inconsistencies relative to the chemical nature and biological activities of endotoxins might be explained on the basis of these two activities and the failure to recognize the importance of the immunological state of the host in which the toxins are tested."}

The reaction of 1 results in the formation of the 1,2-intrastrand d(GG) adduct as the major final product. The two most abundant products of 2 were identified as isomeric 1,2-intrastrand d(GG) adducts differing probably in platinum coordination to the triazole ring.

Recently many researchers from Iberian-American countries have been studying DF of food and industrial residues in order to improve technological knowledge about concentrates production as well as the development and test of enriched products originated from regional food. The present study aimed to evaluate the regional DF potential based on compilation of data about this nutrient. There is great availability of regional and traditional food with considerable DF amounts as we may find in fruits, vegetables and cereals and legumes. Concentrated sources of DF obtained from different industrial residues were characterized and evaluated making possible their utilization in food enrichment. Cookies added to corn residues (16.8% DF in integral weight) in Colombia, and pasta added to lupine fiber in Chile (11.2%) are examples of tested enriched products. Products like bread with whole wheat (12%), products for especial uses as well as pills of citric DF (55%) and food for enteral diets (1-1.9%) are already available on Cuba market. The dietary fiber contents presented in this work allow us to have an idea of the potential of such nutrient in Iberian-American countries. Such potential has been proved to be considerably representative. It is worth to inform that the complete DF database is available on the CYTED X1.6/CNPq Project Web site (http://www.fcf.usp.br/cytedxi16).

Here we investigated the induction of antibody responses to hepadnaviral surface antigens in the woodchuck model, with emphasis on the vaccination of woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). Naive and chronically WHV-infected woodchucks were immunized with plasma-derived WHV surface antigens (p-WHsAg) containing the S and PreS sequences. Antibody responses to WHsAg and the WHV PreS region and viral load in immunized woodchucks were monitored. After repeated immunizations with WHsAg, 17 of 18 chronic WHV carriers developed a persistent antibody response to WHsAg. These antibodies were mainly directed to epitopes within the PreS region and detectable by Western blotting. However, neither WHV DNA nor WHsAg concentrations in these woodchucks changed significantly by immunizations and during the follow up. Sequence analysis of WHV genomes showed that no WHV mutants emerged after the induction of anti-WHs/anti-WHpreS antibodies. No immunopathological changes in livers of immunized animals were recognized thus far. Our study demonstrated that the immunological unresponsiveness of chronically WHV-infected woodchucks to WHsAg can be partially overcome by repeated immunizations with WHsAg."}

A number of studies have attempted to detect structural and functional abnormalities that might be the origin of problems in learning to read. The use of functional neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET), spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (SMRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables us to measure changes in the metabolic activity associated with alterations in the neuronal networks involved in the reading process. In this review, different studies are analysed in an attempt to identify alterations in the cortico subcortical regions which could be the origin of the developmental dyslexia. Results show that in dyslexics there is a temporoparietooccipital disconnection, and a disconnection with the left frontal cortex as regards the demands for fast auditory processing, as well as abnormalities in the connections between the temporoparietal cortex and the cerebellum with other regions of the brain. Such findings suggest that the altered areas of the brain do not only show a characteristic pattern of hypoactivation, but also that these alterations could be the cause of this malady. We highlight the importance of these findings in the diagnosis and rehabilitation of this population."}

In both cases (A and B), the C-C coupling dimer was obtained as a solely isolable product in approximately 50% yield base on the dicopper-dioxygen (Cu(2)/O(2)) complexes, suggesting that both A and B act as electron-transfer oxidants for the phenol oxidation. The rate-dependence in the oxidation of phenols by the Cu(2)/O(2) complexes on the one-electron oxidation potentials of the phenol substrates as well as the kinetic deuterium isotope effects obtained using ArOD have indicated that the reaction involves a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism. The reactivity of phenols for net hydrogen atom transfer reactions to cumylperoxyl radical (C) has also been investigated to demonstrate that the rate-dependence of the reaction on the one-electron oxidation potentials of the phenols is significantly smaller than that of the reaction with the Cu(2)O(2) complexes, indicative of the direct hydrogen atom transfer mechanism (HAT). Thus, the results unambiguously confirmed that the oxidation of phenols by the Cu(2)O(2) complex proceeds via the PCET mechanism rather than the HAT mechanism involved in the cumylperoxyl radical system. The reactivity difference between A and B has also been discussed by taking account of the existed fast equilibrium between A and B."}

The DNA from 115 cases of prostate cancer (Japanese population) was analyzed by sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing to determine the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the six different polymorphic loci of ERalpha. The relative risk of variant genotype was calculated by comparison with 200 healthy controls. Results of this study showed that the frequency of the variant genotype (C/C) on codon 10 was significantly higher in prostate cancer patients. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated as 3.26 compared to wild-type (T/T) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.58-6.73. Allele frequency at codon 10 also differed between groups. No association was found between codon 10 polymorphism and the stage of cancer. Polymorphism was not observed in codon 87, and frequencies of genotypes and alleles at other loci (intron 1, codons 243, 325, and 594) were not statistically different between cancer and controls. The present study suggests that polymorphism in codon 10 of ERalpha may be a risk factor for prostate cancer.

The dense particles are not found in such nucleoli. In Allium the boundary is more irregular and dense particles are sometimes observed in the outer layer. Many nucleoli show a structure intermediate between these two types. They are characterized by a gradient of increasing density from the center to the periphery and occasionally contain dense 140 A granules. During interphase, certain nucleoli are closely associated with segments of chromatin strands which undoubtedly represent nucleolar organizing regions. The dense 140 A granules are followed during the mitotic cycle. In Allium, they are first seen in loose clusters between arms of late anaphase chromosomes where they become more concentrated in early telophase. The substance within which they are scattered slowly increases in density during that time until finally, the particles are limited to small bodies of distinctive character. Evidence is presented suggesting that these small prenucleolar bodies fuse during telophase to give rise to the mature interphase nucleoli. Similar events are described in Vicia material except that a coating of dense substance appears around telophase chromosomes before the formation of prenucleolar bodies."}

Solvent extraction of components from fruit parts (waxy layer, cuticle, and pulp) was applied. The extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography. The sorption time profiles for such citrus fruits as kumquats and mandarins were determined by plotting the extracted mass, or the relationship C/C(0), versus the sorption time of toluene. After the sorption process the highest concentration of toluene was observed in the flavedo, where the oil glands of kumquats and mandarins are located. The data obtained prove that the high dissolution of aromatic hydrocarbons results from the presence of essential oils in the oil glands.

Previous studies have revealed that DGK consists of a family of isozymes in mammalian species and that most if not all of them show abundant expression in the central nervous system, suggesting the importance of this enzyme in neuronal function. Among the isozymes, DGK zeta (previously also known as DGK-IV for the rat clone) has unique structural features, such as four ankyrin-like repeats and a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and shows intense mRNA expression in neurons of the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebral and cerebellar cortices (Goto, K. & Kondo, H. (1996), Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 93, 11196-11201). However, previous studies have given conflicting results about whether or not DGK zeta localizes to the nucleus in these cells. In this study, we have used immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies in brain tissues and cDNA transfection into primary cultured neurons to address this question. We have shown that, while DGK zeta is primarily a nuclear protein in neurons, it can also be cytoplasmic in some conditions, and the subcellular location depends not only on the cell type but also on the developmental state or growth conditions of the cell. In addition, we have used deletion mutants to show that nuclear transport of DGK zeta depends on a cooperative interaction between the NLS and the C-terminal region including ankyrin repeats in a manner which suggests that the NLS is a cryptic site whose exposure is regulated by the C-terminal region. Together, these results support the hypothesis that the localization of DGK zeta may be regulated by differential expression of these various proteins which interact with its C-terminal region."}

Virtually nothing is known about its formation or pathogenetic impact. We evaluated 10 patients with ALL using 38 microsatellite markers mapped to 18 of the 24 human chromosomes to investigate the mechanisms underlying hyperdiploidy and to ascertain the parental origin of the trisomies. Based on the results, doubling of a near-haploid clone and polyploidization with subsequent losses of chromosomes could be excluded. The finding of equal allele dosage for tetrasomy 21 suggests that hyperdiploidy originates in a single aberrant mitosis, though a sequential gain of chromosomes other than 21 in consecutive cell divisions remains a possibility. Our study, the first to address experimentally the parental origin of trisomies in ALL, revealed no preferential duplication of maternally or paternally inherited copies of X, 4, 6, 9, 10, 17, 18, and 21. Trisomy 8 was of paternal origin in 4 of 4 patients (P =.125), and +14 was of maternal origin in 7 of 8 patients (P =.0703).

That is, observing one reversal at the expense of another reversal indicates a subject can adequately inhibit these various interpretations successfully, with more reversals indicating a higher ability to inhibit information successfully. Although it was predicted that negative priming performance would be related to the number of Necker Cube reversals, this was not the case (r = -.07)."}

A chest X-ray of a 55-year-old woman who had been suffering from a cough with sputum for several months revealed an abnormal nodular shadow. A chest CT scan revealed a solitary tumor with cystic appearance occupying S7 of the right lung and the inferior pulmonary ligament. Radiological differential diagnosis for the lesion included bronchogenic cyst, cystic Schwannoma, pulmonary necrotic carcinoid, and lung carcinoma. Right lower lobectomy was carried out and the lesion was pathologically diagnosed as sclerosing hemangioma of the lung with cystic features, expanding into the pulmonary ligament. Differential diagnosis of the cystic lesion of the lung should include cystic sclerosing hemangioma as observed in this case."}

Forty-one of these operative procedures were performed in conjunction with the primary or secondary surgical treatment of malignant neoplasm arising in the pelvis. There were six postoperative deaths in this group of patients, none due to the urinary diversion. The remaining patients were observed for periods of from three to sixty months, the mean average eighteen months. During that period, only one patient died (at 42 months) as the result of urinary diversion. In that case death came about because the patient insisted on wearing a Foley retention catheter rather than an ileostomy bag, and the catheter perforated the ileal segment. In only three of the patients did pyelonephritis develop, and the disease was controlled by giving chemotherapeutic agents. In ten patients, some changes in postoperative intravenous pyelograms were observed."}

S. chartarum was grown on 13 modified plasterboards under saturated humidity conditions. The biomass was estimated by measuring the ergosterol content of the S. chartarum culture while the spore-induced cytotoxicity and production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-6 in mouse macrophages was used to illustrate the bioactivity of spores. The ergosterol content of S. chartarum correlated with the number of spores collected from plasterboards. The growth and sporulation decreased compared to that of the reference board in those cases where (i) the liner was treated with biocide, (ii) starch was removed from the plasterboard, or (iii) desulfurization gypsum was used in the core. Spores collected from all the plasterboards were toxic to the macrophages. The biocide added to the core did not reduce the growth; in fact, the spores collected from that board evoked the highest cytotoxicity. The conventional additives used in the core had inhibitory effects on growth. Recycled plasterboards used in the core and the board lacking the starch triggered spore-induced TNF-alpha production in macrophages. In summary, this study shows that the growth of a strain of S. chartarum on plasterboard and the subsequent bioactivity of spores were affected by minor changes to the composition of the core or liners, but it could not be totally prevented without resorting to the use of biocides. However, incomplete prevention of microbial growth by biocides even increased the cytotoxic potential of the spores."}

This is the first result in this order, Lepidoptera. It showed the pattern of the VLDL receptor belonging to the LDL receptor family. Sequence homology with other Lp receptors in insects, Locusta migratoria and Aedes aegypti, was 70 and 61%, respectively and each domain was highly conserved. Polyclonal anti-Lp receptor antibody prepared against expressed Lp receptor fragment between ligand binding domain and EGF-precursor homology domain (R305-D549 of amino acid residues) specifically detected the Lp receptor. Through immuno-blotting, the Lp receptor of larval fat body has an approximate molecular mass of about 97 and 110 kDa under non-reducing and reducing conditions, respectively. This result was in agreement with that of the ligand-blotting. The variant Lp receptors were expressed in the fat body of G. mellonella; one is an Lp receptor which lacks 84 bp of O-linked sugar domain and the other is a full length form of the Lp receptor. Both forms were detected by the polyclonal anti-Lp receptor antibody. The Lp receptor from the fat body of G. mellonella was differently expressed depending on the tissue and the developmental stage with specific abundance in prepupal stage. A steroid hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-HE) plays a crucial role in insect development. With regards to this conception, day 1-2 last instar larvae were treated with 20-HE and drastic induction of the Lp receptor was observed 48 h after treatment. It was also observed that cholesterol caused an induction of the Lp receptor."}

Crystal structures of a quinoid dye and a phenolic dye precursor are presented. The dyes are sensitive to the dipolarity-polarizability of the medium and to the hydrogen-bond donor ability of protic solvents. Their solvatochromism is discussed in terms of Kamlet-Taft's pi* and alpha scales, and their difference in behaviour is interpreted. Alkali and alkaline earth metal salts effect halochromism, with one exception due to extreme steric hindrance. Thus, this dye is capable of measuring solvent polarities without sensing the presence of electrolytes. Preferential solvation of the dyes in a series of binary solvent mixtures is explained quantitatively by solvent-exchange models."}

However, the role of nutritional support in the enhancement of the benefits of exercise training has not been explored. A double blind, randomised, controlled trial of carbohydrate supplementation was undertaken in patients attending outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation. 85 patients with COPD were randomised to receive a 570 kcal carbohydrate rich supplement or a non-nutritive placebo daily for the duration of a 7 week outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme. Primary outcome measures were peak and submaximal exercise performance using the shuttle walk tests. Changes in health status, body composition, muscle strength, and dietary macronutrient intake were also measured. Patients in both the supplement and placebo groups increased shuttle walking performance and health status significantly. There was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups in these outcomes. Patients receiving placebo lost weight whereas supplemented patients gained weight. In well nourished patients (BMI >19 kg/m(2)) improvement in incremental shuttle performance was significantly greater in the supplemented group (mean difference between groups: 27 (95% CI 1 to 53) m, p<0.05). Increases in incremental shuttle performance correlated with increases in total carbohydrate intake. When universally prescribed, carbohydrate supplementation does not enhance the rehabilitation of patients with COPD. This study suggests that exercise training results in negative energy balance that can be overcome by supplementation and that, in selected patients, this may improve the outcome of training. The finding of benefit in well nourished patients may suggest a role for nutritional supplementation beyond the treatment of weight loss in COPD."}

Identification of soil factors that exert the greatest influence on disease suppression is essential to improving biocontrol. In order to assess the relative importance of 28 soil properties on take-all suppression, seeds were treated with strain 2-79RN(10) (which produces phenazine-1-carboxylate [PCA(+)]) or a series of mutants with PCA(+) and PCA(-) phenotypes. Bacterized seeds were planted in 10 soils, representative of the wheat-growing region in the Pacific Northwest. Sixteen soil properties were correlated with disease suppression. Biocontrol activity of PCA(+) strains was positively correlated with ammonium-nitrogen, percent sand, soil pH, sodium (extractable and soluble), sulfate-sulfur, and zinc. In contrast, biocontrol was negatively correlated with cation-exchange capacity (CEC), exchangeable acidity, iron, manganese, percent clay, percent organic matter (OM), percent silt, total carbon, and total nitrogen. Principal component factor analysis of the 16 soil properties identified a three-component solution that accounted for 87 percent of the variance in disease rating (biocontrol). A model was identified with step-wise regression analysis (R(2) = 0.96; Cp statistic = 6.17) that included six key soil properties: ammonium-nitrogen, CEC, iron, percent silt, soil pH, and zinc. As predicted by our regression model, the biocontrol activity of 2-79RN(10) was improved by amending a soil low in Zn with 50 micro g of zinc-EDTA/g of soil. We then investigated the negative correlation of OM with disease suppression and found that addition of OM (as wheat straw) at rates typical of high-OM soils significantly reduced biocontrol activity of 2-79RN(10)."}

Sixty healthy adults (mean = 28.3 years) without wheelchair experience performed one course trial. Participants were randomly assigned to an UWC or a SWC. Researchers recorded time for completion, Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), and number, location, and types of errors committed. Errors included contact of WC and any obstacle, front casters leaving the ground, or loss of directional control (veering). A MANOVA of the data (p < 0.05) showed a significant difference in numbers of contact errors (higher in the SWC) and castor errors (higher in the UWC) between the two wheelchairs. Number of veering errors, time to complete, and RPE were not significantly different. Differences in wheelchair design can lead to differences in a user's performance of functional mobility skills.

Furthermore, after analyzing the interplay between factors that may impose limits upon an animal's use of time and energy, we call for a program of research in integrative and comparative biology that simultaneously considers evolutionary ecology (including physiological and behavioral ecology) and neurobiology (including cognitive mechanisms as well structural design). We believe that this approach represents a shift in scientific attitude among biologists concerning the place of biological and ecological topics in studies of integrative and comparative biology and biological diversity and vice versa."}

To investigate the influence of FoxM1B on liver tumor formation, we examined the effect of sustained enrichment of FoxM1B in the hepatocytes of mice treated with a diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/phenobarbital tumor induction protocol. Tg enrichment of FoxM1B in hepatocytes did not increase the proliferation rate in normal liver tissue even when the protein was localized to the nucleus. However, it did cause an increase in the proliferation rate and size of preneoplastic and early neoplastic lesions, although having no effects on the total numbers of these lesions. As tumors progressed to hepatocellular carcinomas, the additional Tg FoxM1B protein had no effect on cell proliferation, and there was no increase in tumor burden compared to wild-type animals. This suggests that the artificial enrichment of FoxM1B in the liver, which has been suggested as a gene therapy protocol for liver dysfunction with aging, may not be tumorigenic in that organ."}

Measurements were made weekly between June 1998 and April 2000 at a rural forested upland site in SE Scotland. Rainwater TCA concentration did not differ significantly between two elevations (602 and 275 m asl), with precipitation-weighted mean values of 0.77 and 0.70 microg L(-1), respectively (n > 75). The precipitation-weighted mean concentration of TCA in cloudwater at the highest elevation was 0.92 microg L(-1), yielding an average cloudwater enrichment factor of 1.2, considerably lower than for other inorganic ions measured. Rainwater and cloudwater TCA concentrations did not vary systematically with season. Since wet precipitation depth also did not vary systematically with season, the wet deposition fluxes of TCA were likewise invariant (annual fluxes at the highest elevation of 880 and 130 microg m(-2), respectively, for rain and cloud interception to spruce forest). Weekly integrated concentrations of TCA in air (gas and particle) were very low (median 25 pg m(-3), range < LOD-110 pg m(-3)). The estimated upper limit for annual dry deposition of TCA at this site was approximately 20 microg m(-2), assuming a deposition velocity of 2 cm s(-1). Concentrations of TCA in air correlated reasonably strongly with concentrations in rainwater, with a partition ratio approximately equal to the Henry's law coefficient. On average, only about 23% of TCA measured in Edinburgh air was associated with the particle phase. These measurements are consistent with the observed high scavenging ratio of TCA (ratio of concentration in air to concentration in rainwater). Overall, these data confirm that the atmosphere is an important source of TCA to the environment and that precipitation is the dominant transfer mechanism. In line with previous work, the atmospheric deposition flux is greater than expected from the current understanding of atmospheric production of TCA from anthropogenic precursors. It is suggested that aqueous-phase processes could lead to greater atmospheric conversion of chlorinated solvent precursors to TCA than is currently accepted."}

In 10 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 108.6 mM Na(+), no sequence preferences in the interaction of ciprofloxacin with DNA was detected, while in 2 mM cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0) containing only 1.7 mM Na(+), a significant binding of ciprofloxacin to natural and synthetic linear double-stranded DNA was observed. At low ionic strength of solution, ciprofloxacin binding to DNA duplex containing alternating AT base pairs is accompanied by the largest enhancement in thermal stability (e.g. DeltaT(m) approximately 10 degrees C for poly[d(AT)].poly[d(AT)]), and the most pronounced red shift in the position of the maximum of the fluorescence emission spectrum (lambda(max)). Similar red shift in the position of lambda(max) is also observed for ciprofloxacin binding to dodecameric duplex containing five successive alternating AT base pairs in the row. On the other hand, ciprofloxacin binding to poly[d(GC)].poly[d(GC)], calf thymus DNA and dodecameric duplex containing a mixed sequence is accompanied by the largest fluorescence intensity quenching. Addition of NaCl does not completely displace ciprofloxacin bound to DNA, indicating the binding is not entirely electrostatic in origin. The intrinsic viscosity data suggest some degree of ciprofloxacin intercalation into duplex."}

This regulation is achieved through cell surface insertion/retrieval of channels, by changes in channel open probability (Po), or through a combination of these processes. Epithelium-derived serine proteases, including channel activating protease (CAP) and prostasin, regulate epithelial Na+ transport, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that extracellular serine proteases activate a near-silent ENaC population resident in the plasma membrane. Single-channel events were recorded in outside-out patches from fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) stably expressing rat alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits (rENaC), before and during exposure to trypsin, a serine protease homologous to CAP and prostasin. Under baseline conditions, near-silent patches were defined as having rENaC activity (NPo) < 0.03, where N is the number of channels. Within 1-5 min of 3 microg/ml bath trypsin superfusion, NPo increased approximately 66-fold (n = 7). In patches observed to contain a single functional channel, trypsin increased Po from 0.02 +/- 0.01 to 0.57 +/- 0.03 (n = 3, mean +/- SE), resulting from the combination of an increased channel open time and decreased channel closed time. Catalytic activity was required for activation of near-silent ENaC. Channel conductance and the Na+/Li+ current ratio with trypsin were similar to control values. Modulation of ENaC Po by endogenous epithelial serine proteases is a potentially important regulator of epithelial Na+ transport, distinct from the regulation achieved by hormone-induced plasma membrane insertion of channels."}

Observational study of pulmonary physiology and melatonin levels in patients with nocturnal asthma (n = 7), non-nocturnal asthma (n = 13), and healthy controls (n = 11). Subjects maintained a constant sleep-wake regimen for 7 days. On day 8, serum melatonin was measured every 2 hours by radioimmunoassay and analyzed by cosinor modeling. The correlation between serum melatonin levels and overnight change in spirometry was evaluated by Spearman's rank correlation analysis. In subjects with nocturnal asthma, peak melatonin levels were significantly elevated compared with healthy controls (67.6 +/- 5.0 pg/mL versus 53.5 +/- 4.0 pg/mL, P =.03). Melatonin acrophase was delayed in nocturnal asthma (02:54 versus 01:58 in healthy controls, P =.003, and 02:15 in non-nocturnal asthma, P =.01). In subjects with nocturnal asthma, increasing melatonin levels were significantly and inversely correlated with overnight change in FEV(1) (r = -.79, P =.04), a relationship that was not observed in non-nocturnal asthma or healthy controls.

To understand the point of ghrelin action a group of patients with organic lesion mainly in the hypothalamic area and matched controls were studied. Patients showed a severe GH deficiency after hypothalamic stimulation (ITT), but partial response after GHRH administration. Cases and controls were tested on three separate days by either ghrelin; GHRH; and ghrelin plus GHRH; always at 1 micro g/Kg iv. The mean GH peak after stimulation in the patients were: 0.4 +/- 0.1 micro g/L by ITT; 3.1 +/- 0.5 micro g/L after GHRH; 2.0 +/- 0.8 micro g/L after ghrelin; and 9.6 +/- 2.9 micro g/L after the combination of GHRH plus ghrelin. In the controls GHRH induced a GH peak of 21.2 +/- 7.5 micro g/L, and 75.1 +/- 16.0 micro g/L after ghrelin with a peak after GHRH + ghrelin of 103.5 +/- 26.4 micro g/L. These data indicate that when hypothalamic structures are not operative ghrelin, either alone or in combination with GHRH, is not able to significantly release GH. In addition to postulating a hypothalamic point of action for the ghrelin-induced GH secretion, these results suggests that ghrelin will not have significant clinical utility in patients with GH deficiency due to organic lesion."}

Only the 80-mL volume tended to have a larger distribution, although the 20-mL volume showed the same maximal distribution in two subjects. No distinct relationship between volume, retrograde colonic spread and plasma concentrations could be found. Ropivacaine was well tolerated. Rectal ropivacaine gel in all volumes between 20 and 80 mL can spread up to the descending colon.

Biopsy specimens from 6 patients with mitral stenosis who underwent valve replacement were examined as control hearts (CHs). Plasma levels of IL-2 soluble receptor (sIL-2R) were measured as a marker of systemic immune reaction. In CHs, DR+ cells were undetectable, and cytokine and iNOS mRNA expression were negligible. UA patients had higher sIL-2R levels than SA patients (P<0.01), and their biopsy specimens showed both numerous DR+ cells identified as lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, and elevated expression levels of cytokine and iNOS genes (from 2.4- to 6.1-fold vs SA; P<0.01). Cytokine and iNOS genes and proteins were localized in endothelial cells without involvement of myocytes. IL-1beta and MCP-1 mRNAs were nearly undetectable. No significant differences were found in the number of DR+ cells, levels of cytokine, and iNOS genes between potentially ischemic and nonischemic left ventricle areas.

Some health researchers have criticised the Act, seeing it as a legal minefield, unnecessary bureaucracy and interference from the European Union. This is largely based on misconceptions. Recent guidance from the Information Commissioner aims to assist researchers by advising how legal requirements can be met through anonymisation of data, attention to data-processing methods and fair collection of data. The Act provides a clear framework of rights and responsibilities that should be embraced with enthusiasm rather than with the reluctance of a person forced to carry out a meaningless chore."}

Data concerning sex differences in cortisol response patterns have revealed inconsistent results so far. The purpose of the present study was to examine sex differences in subjective pain and cortisol response to a noxious stressor. Seventy-six subjects (39 male and 37 female) were investigated by a modification of the cold pressor test that consisted of intermittent immersion of the hand into ice water (plunge test, PT). The PT was conducted twice, in consecutive trials, to guarantee a sufficient exposure to the noxious stressor for eliciting cortisol responses. In each trial, tolerance time and pain ratings visual analog scale (VAS) were assessed. Seven saliva samples (c1-c7) were collected to determine cortisol levels at baseline (c1-c2), directly before (c3) and 20 minutes after noxious stress (c4), and during recovery period (c5-c7). We found no significant sex differences in tolerance time in trial 1, but highly significant differences in tolerance time in trial 2, with higher tolerance times in men. No significant sex differences were found for the VAS ratings of pain intensity and unpleasantness in the 2 trials. In contrast, a significantly larger cortisol increase in men was observed compared with women. Analysis of covariance revealed that this result could not be attributed to sex differences in cortisol level at baseline and in tolerance time. The present study demonstrates that men show a larger cortisol response to a noxious stressor than women that is not attributable to sex differences in subjective pain. The conclusion of a causal relation between larger cortisol responses and higher pain tolerance thresholds in men is tempting but yet speculative."}

Whereas the detrimental cardiovascular effects of smoking are well documented, possible health hazards associated with the use of smokeless tobacco remain controversial. The purpose of this study was to explore whether the use of snuff, a smokeless tobacco product, increases the risk of stroke in men. In a nested case-control study (1 case and 2 matched controls without cardiovascular disease), information on tobacco habits was collected through population risk factor surveys. During follow-up, first-ever fatal and nonfatal strokes occurring among 25- to 74-year-old participants were identified in a population-based stroke register. The study was restricted to men (276 cases, 551 controls). The unadjusted odds ratio for stroke in regular cigarette smokers compared with men who never used tobacco was 2.21 (95% CI, 1.29 to 3.79). When never-smoking regular snuff dippers (excluding ex-smokers) were compared with men who never used tobacco, the unadjusted odds ratio was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.37 to 2.94). The odds ratio for never-snuffing smokers versus never-smoking snuff users was 2.90 (95% CI, 0.92 to 9.1). After adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors, the odds ratio for having a stroke was 1.74 (95% CI, 0.85 to 3.54) in regular smokers and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.41 to 1.83) in regular snuff users. Whereas regular smoking doubles the risk of stroke in men, snuff use is not associated with any apparent excess risk. Chemical moieties produced by burning tobacco are probably the most important contributors to smokers' excess risk of atherothrombotic disease, including stroke."}

A prospective open study. A medical intensive care unit of a university hospital. Acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, with hypercapnia (PaCO(2)>60 mmHg). A progressive reduction of the humidification system dead space (DSh). The following five conditions were tested sequentially: (1). heat and moisture exchanger (internal volume=95 ml) with a tracheal closed-suction system (internal volume=25 ml; total DSh=120 ml), (2). heat and moisture exchanger (internal volume=45 ml) with the closed-suction system (DSh=70 ml), (3). heat and moisture exchanger (internal volume=25 ml) with the closed-suction system (DSh=50 ml), (4). heated humidifier with the closed-suction system (DSh=25 ml) and (5). heated humidifier alone (DSh=0 ml). Recordings were performed at baseline and every 30 min after each artificial dead-space reduction. All ventilatory settings remained constant during the measurement periods. Ten ARDS patients were included. A significant PaCO(2) decrease was observed at each humidification system dead-space reduction, compared to baseline: PaCO(2 )=80.3+/-20 mmHg at DSh(120) compared to PaCO(2 )=63.6+/-13 mmHg at DSh(0) ( p<0.05). No changes were observed for hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters between the different humidification devices. Artificial airway dead-space reduction allows a significant PaCO(2) reduction. Independently of any respiratory mechanical changes, this very simple maneuver may be of importance when low tidal volume ventilation is used in ARDS patients, and when PaCO(2) lowering is warranted."}

The Koran describes the creation of human beings in verses 22:5, 23:12 and 39:6. Some descriptions are reminiscent of phrases in Genesis and Ecclesiastes of the Old Testament. Symbiosis between mother and child is implicit in Koranic verse 46:15, which defines this period as lasting for 30 mo. Accumulated knowledge from earlier periods on the beneficial effects of breastfeeding is reflected in verse 2:233, as a recommendation that infants be breastfed for 2 y. In early Islam it was a father's obligation to ensure that his child received human milk, if the biological mother was indisposed to provide it. Securing human milk was of vital importance for the survival of the child. The historical solution was to employ a wet nurse. Paying a good salary to wet nurses and giving them a status similar to that of a biological mother was a precaution for securing that babies received sufficient milk. During the period of Islamic expansion, the medieval physician Ibn Sina of Buckara (AD 980-1037) contributed to the significance of breastfeeding by describing breast milk as \"white blood\". The significance of breastfeeding was recognized in early texts of the Islamic tradition. These have inspired positive attitudes to breastfeeding in Muslim communities. Adherence may differ among contemporary groups, but it may be important to keep original teachings in mind when planning breastfeeding programmes in Muslim communities."}

As studies in experimental animals suggest that the MT2 melatonin receptor subtype is also present in the vasculature, we investigated whether the MT2 is expressed in human aorta and coronary arteries. Additionally, MT2 expression in human ventricular specimens was analysed, as melatonin was shown to affect myocyte function. Expression of the MT2-receptor was studied in sections of isolated coronary arteries, aorta and left ventricular specimens from healthy heart donors (control) and patients with dilated or ischemic cardiomyopathy. MT2 expression was found by reverse transcriptase (RT)-nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all of the specimens (aorta, left ventricle and coronary arteries) derived from controls. Also, visible evidence for receptor expression was found in 12 of 15 samples from cardiomyopathy patients and 10 of 15 of coronary heart disease patients. Additionally, the expression of MT2-receptor between aorta, left ventricle and coronary arteries varied among the individuals, some of them showing highest expression in the aorta while in others principal expression sites were coronary arteries or left ventricles. In conclusion, the MT2-receptor subtype is present in human arteries and left ventricles and it is suggested that in coronary heart disease MT2-receptor expression is altered. Furthermore, there is evidence for heterogeneous MT2 expression patterns in individual patients."}

So far no animal model has allowed an explanation of all facets of the clinically heterogeneous condition migraine. However, it is now generally accepted that the migraine headache is due to activation of the trigeminal system. The model of neurogenic inflammation after stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion or systemic administration of capsaicin allows study of the inhibitory interactions between antimigraine compounds and peripheral trigeminal fibre terminals that sustain a sterile meningeal inflammation through release of allogenic and vasoactive neuropeptides, such as substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Studies with the model of superior sagittal sinus stimulation have revealed central actions of antimigraine agents such as ergotamine and sumatriptan, but also acetylsalicylic acid on neurotransmission of trigeminal nociceptive input in the brainstem. A likely explanation for the slowly progressing neurological deficits is cortical spreading depression (CSD), which can easily be elicited in many species. However, CSD has not been observed in vivo in humans. The described models strongly influenced the development of new medications for migraine treatment and have improved our understanding of migraine pathophysiology."}

Theoretical study considering the concept of collectivity.", "abstract": "Equilibrium structures of novel dendrimeric compounds consisting of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) mono- to tetra-substituted with four different dendrimeric branches have been studied. It has been shown using molecular dynamics (MD) that, even in the presence of the macrocycle cyclen, the most stable conformations are those with a globular shape due to close contact interactions between poly-functional branches. No collapse of cyclen occurred, making this cavity available for metal complexation. Terminal branches A=NHCOOtBu, B=OSi(Me)2tBu, C=Imidazole and D=CN have different molecular volumes in the decreasing order: B>A>C>D. This conclusion is in accord with the long range interaction energies, showing that the larger the volume the less the steric hindrance. Considering these energy values, the stability of the systems follows exactly the same tendency as observed for the molecular volume. More polar groups like A=NHCOOtBu and D=CN impart extra stability due to long range interactions between atoms separated by exactly three chemical bonds. The negative charge inside the cyclen cavity increases with the volume of the branches. Besides cyclen, urea groups located at the middle of the branches represent another independent point of negative charge for eventual interaction with small molecules. These compounds show a sum of small contributions of the functionalities in a collective fashion."}

If with a poor combination of the above parameters AR developed in 100%; with their relative combination, it occurred in 78%. With other types of their combinations, AR took place only in 38%. A new method for preventing AR in pulmonary tuberculosis is proposed by using non-traditional methods, such as phytotherapy alone and in combination with ultraviolet autoblood irradiation. The use of this method is shown to reduce the incidence of AR, to attenuate their severity and clinical manifestations particularly in patients with a relatively poor genetic background."}

Several associations have been noted on a few studies but results were not consistent, except for exposure to farming among cases and their parents. Here we present the non-farm findings of a nationwide case-control study of ESFT in children and young adults in Australia. The analysis included 106 persons with confirmed ESFT and 344 population-based controls selected randomly via telephone. Information was collected by interview (84% face to face). We found a strong and significant association of ESFT with hernias, in particular hernia repaired in hospital (OR = 5.6, 95% CI 1.3-6.4). Among other factors, there was a near doubling of risk for males, and male cases had their pubertal signs earlier (started shaving earlier) than male controls. There was also an increased risk of ESFT at higher levels of self-assessed exercise, but no other factor really stood out. For pregnancy-related factors, there was a tripling of risk for glandular fever, a doubling of risk for urinary tract infection and a near doubling of risk for X-rays during or just before pregnancy, but these estimates were not significant. In addition, there was a large number of inverse associations with medical conditions (specifically bone disorders), case exposure to medications, vaccinations and X-rays, with ultrasound during the pregnancy having the most certain effects. We conclude that, although the aetiology of ESFT remains obscure, overall there is strong evidence of an association with inguinal hernia; this can now be added to the farm-associated risk reported by others and us. The other associations reported here await replication and refinement in future studies."}

In the treatment group the patient received 250 mg Solu-Medrol intravenously and 160 mg Depo-Medrol intramuscularly. Before closure of the wound, a free fat transplant soaked in 80 mg Depo-Medrol was placed on the dural sac. In the control group the same procedure was performed, but sodium chloride was given instead of Depo-Medrol. All patients underwent a clinical examination before surgery and at 2, 6, 12, 26, 52 and 104 weeks postoperatively, rating their pain with the visual analog scale (VAS) and function with the Disability Rating Index (DRI). The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter (P=0.01) in the treatment group (1.7 days) compared to the control group (2.3 days). Time taken to return to full-time work was also significantly shorter in the treatment group (P=0.003). VAS-W (Worst Pain during last week) was significantly lower in the treatment group (P=0.02). Postoperative spondylitis occurred in one patient in the control group and no adverse corticosteroids effect was seen. Our study shows that perioperatively given corticosteroids improve the outcome of microscopic disc surgery in terms of length of hospital stay and time taken to return to full-time work. The results also indicate that corticosteroid treatment reduces pain and improves functional outcome."}

We investigated the effect of a selective inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor, ONO-1714, on the loss of HPV during endotoxemia in awake sheep to clarify the role of iNOS. We prepared 11 intubated, awake sheep with hemodynamic monitoring. Hypoxic challenges (FiO2; 12%) were performed before, and 5, 24, 48, 72 hours after endotoxin (1 microg/kg) infusion for 15 minutes. Pulmonary artery (Ppa) and left atrial pressure (Pla) were continuously measured and cardiac output (CO) was measured by the thermodilution method. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was calculated by (Ppa - Pla)/CO. The percent change in PVR (%PVR) before (pre-PVR) and after (post-PVR) hypoxia was calculated as (post-PVR - pre-PVR)/pre-HPV x 100. ONO-1714 (0.1 mg/kg, n=5, Exp 1) or normal saline (n=6, Exp 2) was administered 5 hours before hypoxic challenge every day. ONO-1714 did not affect the baseline pulmonary hemodynamics before endotoxin administration. % PVR before and after hypoxic exposure was significantly decreased 5 hours after endotoxin administration and gradually improved to baseline at 72 hours. Treatment with iNOS inhibition significantly restored % HPV (24.7+/-5.5% in Exp1 versus -3.1+/-3.6% in Exp 2, 5 hours, 25.3+/-2.5% in Exp 1 versus 7.7+/-2.2% in Exp 2, 24 hours).

The shell contains 240 copies of the trimeric P3 protein arranged with a pseudo T = 25 triangulation that is reminiscent of the mammalian adenovirus. DNA packaging and infection are believed to occur through the vertices of the particle. We have used immunolabeling to define the distribution of proteins on the virion surface. Antibodies to protein P3 labeled the entire surface of the virus. Most of the 12 vertices labeled with antibodies directed against proteins P5, P2, and P31. These proteins are known to function in virus binding to the cell surface. Proteins P6, P11, and P20 were found on a single vertex per virion. The P6 and P20 proteins are believed to function in DNA packaging. Protein P11 is a pilot protein that is involved in a complex that mediates the early stages of DNA entry to the host cell. Labeling with antibodies to P5 or P2 did not affect the labeling of P6, the unique vertex protein. Labeling with antibodies to the unique vertex protein P6 interfered with the labeling by antibodies to the unique vertex protein P20. We conclude that PRD1 utilizes 11 of its vertices for initial receptor binding. It utilizes a single, unique vertex for both DNA packing during assembly and DNA delivery during infection."}

Forty ASA I or II adult patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery were selected for the study. The patients were randomly allocated to receive 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine intrathecally either alone or with 1 mg of midazolam using a combined spinal epidural technique. The duration and quality of sensory and motor block, perioperative analgesia, haemodynamic changes, and sedation levels were assessed. The duration of sensory block (i.e. time to regression to the S2 segment) was significantly longer in the midazolam group than the control group (218 min vs. 165 min; P < 0.001). The duration of motor block was also prolonged in the midazolam group as compared with the control group (P < 0.01). In 90% of the patients in the midazolam group, the quality of block was adequate during the intra-operative period as compared with only 65% of the patients in the control group (P < 0.05). The duration of effective analgesia was longer in the midazolam group than in the control group (199 vs. 103 min; P < 0.001). Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation and sedation scores were comparable in both groups. No neurological deficit or other significant adverse effects were recorded.

An abnormal long-wavelength emission was found for all of the prepared aminonaphthalene derivatives in cyclohexane and was assigned to the CT state by the observation of a substantial red shift with increasing solvent polarity or with increasing electron-withdrawing ability of the substituent. The CT emission energies were found to follow a linear relationship with the Hammett constant of the substituent and the value of the linear slope for 1-NBAs (-0.45 eV) was higher than that of 2-NBAs (-0.35 eV), the latter being close to that of the aniline derivatives (BAs, -0.345 eV). This pointed to a higher extent of charge separation in the CT state of 1-NBAs in which a full charge separation was established by the reduction potential dependence of the CT emission energy with a linear slope of -1.00. The possible contribution of the difference in the steric effect and the electron donating ability of the donors in 1-NBAs and 2-NBAs was ruled out by the observation that the corresponding linear slopes of benzoyl-substituted BAs remained unchanged when para-, meta-, ortho-, or ortho,ortho-methyls were introduced into the aniline moiety. It was therefore concluded that 1-AN enhanced the charge transfer in 1-NBAs and the proximity of its 1La and 1Lb states was suggested to be responsible. Results showed that the charge transfers in 1-NBAs and 2-NBAs were not the same and 1-AN and 2-AN as electron donors were different not only in electron donating ability but in shaping the charge transfer pathway as well."}

At later embryonic and early postnatal ages, RORalpha expression in dorsal thalamus is mainly limited to robust expression throughout the principal sensory nuclei. RORbeta is expressed in a similar set of dorsal thalamic nuclei as RORalpha, but exhibits a more limited expression within the principal sensory nuclei. RORalpha is expressed as early as E12.5 in dorsal thalamus by presumptive ventroposterior neurons, whereas RORbeta expression is not detected until later embryonic ages. RORbeta is highly expressed in embryonic neocortex, and exhibits strongly graded rostrocaudal and lateromedial patterns of expression. Over the first postnatal week, the graded expression of RORbeta gradually acquires a disjunctive pattern largely restricted to layers 4 and 5 of the primary sensory areas. In contrast, very weak RORalpha expression is first detected in the neocortex just around birth, and is limited to the middle layer of the cortical plate of the putative somatosensory area. Later, a limited and very weak RORalpha expression is evident mainly in layer 4 of more caudal areas. To determine whether patterned retinal input is required for the proper postnatal expression and patterning of RORalpha and RORbeta, we performed neonatal bilateral enucleations. We did not detect any significant differences between normal and enucleated mice in expression in visual areas. Although TCA input may be required for proper regulation of the postnatal expression of RORalpha and RORbeta, these findings suggest that aspects of the dynamic postnatal expression and patterning of these genes are regulated independently of patterned visual activity relayed by geniculocortical afferents. The patterned expression of RORalpha in dorsal thalamus suggests that this gene locus may be useful to genetically modify the development of dorsal thalamus and thalamocortical projections."}

Calcipressin 1 is encoded by DSCR1, a gene on human chromosome 21 with seven exons, exons 1-4 are alternative first exons (isoforms 1-4). We show that calcipressin 1 isoform 1 has an N-terminal coding region longer than that previously described, and this generates a new polypeptide of 252 amino acids. This polypeptide is able to interact with calcineurin A and to inhibit NF-AT-mediated transcriptional activation. We demonstrate for the first time that endogenous calcipressin 1 exists as a complex together with the calcineurin A and B heterodimer. Calcipressin 1 is a phosphoprotein that increases its capacity to inhibit calcineurin when phosphorylated at the FLISPP motif, and this phosphorylation also controls the half-life of calcipressin 1 by accelerating its degradation. Additionally, we have also detected further phosphorylation sites outside the FLISPP motif and these contribute to the complex phosphorylation pattern of calcipressin 1. Taking all these results into consideration we suggest that phosphorylation of calcipressin 1 is involved in the regulation of the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and can therefore act as a modulator of calcineurin-dependent cellular pathways."}

In addition, in vitro cleavage of the recombinant 145 kDa precursor by furin generated C-terminal fragments of 65 and 68 kDa, further supporting the involvement of furin in LEKTI processing. In contrast, LEKTI precursors and proteolytic fragments were not detected in differentiated HK from NS patients. Defective expression of LEKTI in skin sections was a constant feature in NS patients, whilst an extended reactivity pattern was observed in samples from other keratinizing disorders, demonstrating that loss of LEKTI expression in the epidermis is a diagnostic feature of NS. The identification of novel processed forms of LEKTI provides the basis for future functional and structural studies of fragments with physiological relevance."}

Generally, this class of compounds is synthesized for research purposes on milligram scales by solid-phase methods, but if the potential of macrocyclic peptidomimetics is to be realized, low-cost larger scale solution-phase syntheses need to be devised and optimized to provide sufficient quantities for preclinical, clinical, and commercial uses. Here, we describe a cheap, medium-scale, solution-phase synthesis of the first reported highly potent, selective, and orally active antagonist of the human C5a receptor. This compound, Ac-Phe[Orn-Pro-d-Cha-Trp-Arg], known as 3D53, is a macrocyclic peptidomimetic of the human plasma protein C5a and displays excellent antiinflammatory activity in numerous animal models of human disease. In a convergent approach, two tripeptide fragments Ac-Phe-Orn(Boc)-Pro-OH and H-d-Cha-Trp(For)-Arg-OEt were first prepared by high-yielding solution-phase couplings using a mixed anhydride method before coupling them to give a linear hexapeptide which, after deprotection, was obtained in 38% overall yield from the commercially available amino acids. Cyclization in solution using BOP reagent gave the antagonist in 33% yield (13% overall) after HPLC purification. Significant features of the synthesis were that the Arg side chain was left unprotected throughout, the component Boc-d-Cha-OH was obtained very efficiently via hydrogenation of d-Phe with PtO(2) in TFA/water, the tripeptides were coupled at the Pro-Cha junction to minimize racemization via the oxazolone pathway, and the entire synthesis was carried out without purification of any intermediates. The target cyclic product was purified (>97%) by reversed-phase HPLC. This convergent synthesis with minimal use of protecting groups allowed batches of 50-100 g to be prepared efficiently in high yield using standard laboratory equipment. This type of procedure should be useful for making even larger quantities of this and other macrocyclic peptidomimetic drugs."}

Health care claims data were derived from a sample of 3,664,686 privately insured individuals. The database was limited to cases of disease for which an insurance claim was generated, with costs reflecting inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy payments from all sources. We identified 5095 cases of genital warts (1.7 cases per 1000 person-years) billed through the health plans during 2000. The prevalences of and health plan costs associated with genital warts were highest among women aged 20-24 years (6.2 cases and $1692 in costs per 1000 person-years) and men aged 25-29 years (5.0 cases and $1717 in costs per 1000 person-years). On average, individual episodes of care for genital warts involved 3.1 physician visits and incurred costs of $436. These are the first age- and sex-specific estimates of the prevalence and cost of genital warts for a US health plan."}

In this work we show that cell proliferation as determined by MIB-1 labeling index (LI) was significantly higher in tumors with LOH of D17S379 than those with no LOH (NLOH). In accord with our previous results, p53 protein immunopositivity was also associated with increased MIB-1 LI; however, we observed no such association of LI with TP53 LOH. The results further confirm that alteration of one or more putative tumor suppressor loci at 17p13.3 is associated with increased proliferation in astrocytic tumors."}

(Stanford Medical Center, Palo Alto, Calif.). Transformation of Bacillus subtilis to motility and prototrophy: micromanipulative isolation of bacteria of transformed phenotype. J. Bacteriol. 86:797-804. 1963.-A nonmotile (nonflagellated, fla(-)) try(-) strain of Bacillus subtilis was transformed to fla(+) and to try(+) by wild - type deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at comparable rates. Bacteria of fla(+) phenotype were recognized by their motility approximately 3 hr after uptake of DNA, and bacteria of try(+) phenotype at about the same time by their elongation into filaments in a medium lacking tryptophan. Of phenotypically transformed bacteria of each sort isolated by micromanipulation, the majority produced only transformed progeny, a mixture of transformed and untransformed, or a mixture of two kinds of transformant. Some produced only untransformed progeny, or progeny transformed only at a locus linked to that concerned in their phenotypic transformation. In a few clones, some partial heterozygotes were present even ten generations after DNA uptake. In nonmotile clones derived from motile isolates, the unilinear transmission of motility to one to four descendants was detected; it is attributed to persistence of a corresponding number of units of some product of an unincorporated fla(+) gene, probably flagella or cell walls each carrying several flagella. No pedigrees indicating unilinear transmission of an unincorporated fla(+) gene were observed."}

Owing to overlaps, Gummelt arrangement of decorated decagons gives rise to nine different (context-dependent) decagon decorations in the covering. The inflation rules for decagons for each of nine types are presented and it is shown that inflations from differently typed decagons always produce different decorations of inflated decagons. However, if the original decagon region is divided into 'equivalent' rhombus Penrose tiles, typed-decagon arrangements in the tiles (of the same shape) become identical for the fourfold inflated decagons. This implies that a decagonal quasi-unit-cell model can be reinterpreted as a Penrose-tile model with fourfold deflated supertiles."}

ICRP Publication 89.", "abstract": "This report presents detailed information on age- and gender-related differences in the anatomical and physiological characteristics of reference individuals. These reference values provide needed input to prospective dosimetry calculations for radiation protection purposes for both workers and members of the general public. The purpose of this report is to consolidate and unify in one publication, important new information on reference anatomical and physiological values that has become available since Publication 23 was published by the ICRP in 1975. There are two aspects of this work. The first is to revise and extend the information in Publication 23 as appropriate. The second is to provide additional information on individual variation among grossly normal individuals resulting from differences in age, gender, race, or other factors. This publication collects, unifies, and expands the updated ICRP reference values for the purpose of providing a comprehensive and consistent set of age- and gender-specific reference values for anatomical and physiological features of the human body pertinent to radiation dosimetry. The reference values given in this report are based on: (a) anatomical and physiological information not published before by the ICRP; (b) recent ICRP publications containing reference value information; and (c) information in Publication 23 that is still considered valid and appropriate for radiation protection purposes. Moving from the past emphasis on 'Reference Man', the new report presents a series of reference values for both male and female subjects of six different ages: newborn, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and adult. In selecting reference values, the Commission has used data on Western Europeans and North Americans because these populations have been well studied with respect to antomy, body composition, and physiology. When appropriate, comparisons are made between the chosen reference values and data from several Asian populations. The first section of the report provides summary tables of all the anatomical and physiological parameters given as reference values in this publication. These results give a comprehensive view of reference values for an individual as influenced by age and gender. The second section describes characteristics of dosimetric importance for the embryo and fetus. Information is provided on the development of the total body and the timing of appearance and development of the various organ systems. Reference values are provided on the mass of the total body and selected organs and tissues, as well as a number of physiological parameters. The third section deals with reference values of important anatomical and physiological characteristics of reference individuals from birth to adulthood. This section begins with details on the growth and composition of the total body in males and females. It then describes and quantifies anatomical and physiological characteristics of various organ systems and changes in these characteristics during growth, maturity, and pregnancy. Reference values are specified for characteristics of dosimetric importance. The final section gives a brief summary of the elemental composition of individuals. Focusing on the elements of dosimetric importance, information is presented on the body content of 13 elements: calcium, carbon, chloride, hydrogen, iodine, iron, magnesium, nitrogen, oxygen, potassium, sodium, sulphur, and phosphorus."}

We studied the NF2 locus on chromosome 22 in 7 tumor specimens resected from a 36-year-old man with schwannomatosis of the right ulnar nerve. Unrelated truncating NF2 gene mutations were detected in 4 tumor specimens. None of the NF2 mutations were present in the blood specimen. Loss of heterozygosity at the NF2 locus was seen in all tumors, and in every case the same allele was lost. Loss of distal chromosome 22 markers was variable. Fluorescence in situ hybridization results were consistent with monosomy 22 in 4 tumors and mitotic recombination or nondisjunction in 1. Molecular analysis of tumor specimens distinguishes schwannomatosis from other forms of neurofibromatosis. Further work is needed to understand the natural history and molecular biology of this condition."}

In the literature little attention has been paid to the early detection of such an increase. In particular the occurrence of a 'Cushing reflex' has not been discussed in this context. Therefore, we have now analysed retrospectively the anesthesia charts of 88 patients with obstructive hydrocephalus who had undergone ETV under general anesthesia. Monitoring included invasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, end-expired carbon dioxide, pulse oximetry and heart rate. These variables were now evaluated before and after the introduction of the endoscope and during and after the occurrence of any change. In 67 patients the procedure had been uneventful. In 6 patients the occurrence of tachycardia and hypertension followed by bradycardia and hypertension was clearly the result of an increase in ICP, which we call a Cushing reflex. In his classical description of this pressure response Cushing reported the occurrence of hypertension, bradycardia and apnoea. However, many investigators have shown that beside systemic hypertension, both tachycardia and bradycardia are essential components of the Cushing reflex. Waiting for a persistent bradycardia to alert the surgeon during ETV can allow a fatal asystole."}

Results were summarized as it follows: 1. In general clavate cell had a single nucleus at its center. However it was observed in Liobagrus mediadiposalis and Pelteobagrus fuluidraco that clavate cell had two nuclei with and independent so-called light halo of Oxner and in some cases had none of them. 2. In following species; Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, Cobitis taenia, Liobagrus mediadiposalis, Pelteobagrus fuluidraco, Parasilurus asotus and Anguilla japonica, scales were not detected or buried in the dermis layer, and the epidermis was mostly consisted of clavate cells. Among these species, it was observed that no metacercariae were found. 3. In case of Cyprinus carpio, Carassius carassius (crusian carp and golden crusian carp), Sarcocheilichthys czerskii, Pungtungia herzi and Coreoleuciscus splendius, scales were exposed over the epidermis, in which clavate cells were abundantly found. In these species, a few of the metacercariae were detected. 4. On the other hand, no clavate cells were observed in Pseudorasbora parva, Zacco platypus, Microphysogobio koreensis, Gnathopogon majimae, Gnathopogon coreanus, Acheilognathus signifer, Acheilognathus yamatsutae, Cultriculus eigenmanni, Coreoperca herzi, Pseudoperilampus uyekii, Pseudoperilampus notatus and Pseudogobio esocinus. These fishes with exposed scales on the epidermis were well known to serve as the second intermediate hosts of C. sinensis. From the above results obtained, it was suggested that the existance of clavate cells in the epidermis of the fresh-water fish seems to be correlated with the infectivity of the metacercariae of C. sinensis."}

The results demonstrate that D2O influences the selective utilization of certain protonated substrates during the formation of triose phosphates. It was found that protonated isotopomers derived from the first glucose fragment C1-C2-C3 are predominantly utilized. This explains why the metabolism slows down by a factor of 2 to 3 if D2O concentration in the medium increases. It was also shown that approximately 10% of the organisms are in the state of dynamic extracellular endosymbiosis. This state is characterized by the ability to exchange the metabolic products through close intercellular contacts. As a result of the metabolic exchange, a multicellular organism is formed, with metabolic elements localized in different partners. A distinguishing feature of this organism is the ability to accumulate the internal resources of carbon, thus making it better adapted to the unfavorable environment."}

Growth of primary s.c. tumor and dissemination of pulmonary metastases was markedly suppressed by this oral DNA vaccine, carried by attenuated Salmonella typhimurium, encoding murine Fos-related antigen 1, fused with mutant polyubiquitin, and cotransformed with secretory murine IL-18. The life span of 60% of vaccinated mice was tripled in the absence of detectable tumor growth after lethal tumor cell challenge. Immunological mechanisms involved activation of T, natural killer, and dendritic cells, as indicated by up-regulation of their activation markers and costimulatory molecules. Markedly increased specific target cell lysis was mediated by both MHC class I-restricted CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells isolated from splenocytes of vaccinated mice, including a significant release of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-2. Importantly, fluorescence analysis of fibroblast growth factor 2 and tumor cell-induced vessel growth in Matrigel plugs demonstrated marked suppression of angiogenesis only in vaccinated animals. Taken together, this multifunctional DNA vaccine proved effective in protecting against growth and metastases of breast cancer by combining the action of immune effector cells with suppression of tumor angiogenesis."}

The development of in vitro cell culture propagation methods has provided researchers with large numbers of spores and facilitated the study of these organisms. Here, we describe heterogeneity within cell culture-propagated Encephalitozoon intestinalis suspensions. Flow cytometer histograms depicting the log side scatter and forward-angle light scatter of spores from nine suspensions produced over 12 months consistently showed two populations differing in size. The suspensions were composed primarily of the smaller-spore subpopulation (76.4% +/- 5.1%). The presence of two subpopulations was confirmed by microscopic examination and image analysis (P < 0.001). Small subpopulation spores were noninfectious in rabbit kidney (RK13) cell culture infectivity assays, while the large spores were infectious when inocula included > or = 25 spores. The small spores stained brilliantly with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody against Encephalitozoon genus spore wall antigen, while the large spores stained poorly. There was no difference in staining intensities using commercial (MicroSporFA) and experimental polyclonal antibodies. Vital-dye (DAPI [4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole], propidium iodide, or SYTOX Green) staining showed the spores of the small subpopulation to be permeable to all vital dyes tested, while spores of the large subpopulation were not permeable in the absence of ethanol pretreatment. PCR using primers directed to the 16S rRNA or beta-tubulin genes and subsequent sequence analysis confirmed both subpopulations as E. intestinalis. Our data suggest that existing cell culture propagation methods produce two types of spores differing in infectivity, and the presence of these noninfective spores in purified spore suspensions should be considered when designing disinfection and drug treatment studies."}

We sought to study the response of activated immunologic cells and keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions to CDS. A total of 27 patients with chronic, stable, plaque-type psoriasis treated with CDS for 28 consecutive days were evaluated with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score and quantitative histologic measures. After 4 weeks of treatment, the overall Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score decreased by 81.5%. Complete clearance was achieved in 48% of the patients, and moderate to marked improvement in 41%. The average duration of remission was 3.3 months. Histologically, there was an overall reduction in malpighian layer thickness by 63.4%, and keratinocyte hyperplasia, assessed by Ki-67 cell cycle antigen expression, decreased by 78%; residual cell proliferation was confined mainly to the basal layer. These changes were accompanied by normalization of keratin 16 expression in 90% of the patients. T lymphocytes were almost totally eliminated from the epidermis (depletion of >90% of CD3(+) and CD25(+) cells), with only a low number remaining in the dermis (depletion of 69.4% of CD3(+) cells and 77.4% of CD25(+) cells). This reduction in activated T cells was accompanied by a marked reduction in HLA-DR expression by epidermal keratinocytes. CDS is a highly effective and remittive treatment for moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis, leading to a reversal of both pathologic epidermal and immunologic activation."}

Rin1, a multifunctional protein, has been shown to regulate EGFR internalization (1). Here we show that EGF stimulation induces a specific, rapid, and transient membrane recruitment of Rin1 and that recruitment is dependent on the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Rin1. Immunoprecipitation of EGFR is accompanied by co-immunoprecipitation of Rin1 in a time- and ligand-dependent manner. Association of Rin1 and specifically the SH2 domain of Rin1 with the EGFR was dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the EGFR. The recruitment of Rin1, observed by light microscopy, indicated that although initially cytosolic, Rin1 was recruited to both plasma membrane and endosomes following EGF addition. Moreover, the expression of the SH2 domain of Rin1 substantially impaired the internalization of EGF without affecting internalization of transferrin. Finally, we found that Rin1 co-immunoprecipitated with a number of tyrosine kinase receptors but not with cargo endocytic receptors. These results indicate that Rin1 provides a link via its SH2 domain between activated tyrosine kinase receptors and the endocytic pathway through the recruitment and activation of Rab5a."}

Although principally considered to be a T cell-associated molecule, CD28 has been seen to be expressed on mast cells and natural killer cells, as well as on plasma and myeloma cells, but not on cells representing earlier stages of B cell development. Here were report that CD28 was expressed on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B lymphoblastoid and AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines. These cells also expressed the ligands for CD28, B7-1 and B7-2, but not CTLA-4. Furthermore, peripheral blood B cells infected with EBV ex vivo expressed CD28 after infection. Cross-linking with a stimulatory anti-CD28 antibody resulted in an increased expression of CD71 (transferrin receptor) or CD25 (interleukin-2 alpha receptor subunit). The addition of a blocking CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein, or antisense oligonucleotides for CD28, resulted in a decreased expression of these molecules. In 1 cell line, the addition of an anti-CD28 stimulatory antibody reduced Fas-induced apoptosis, and antisense oligonucleotide-induced inhibition of CD28 expression enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis. Overall, these results suggest a role for CD28 and its ligands, B7-1 and B7-2, in homotypic interactions in EBV+ B cell lines, which may mediate cellular activation and/or viability."}
{"pmid": "12887296", "title": "Biochemistry and genetics of mannan-binding lectin (MBL).", "abstract": "Mannose- or mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a member of the collectin protein family, which includes lung surfactant proteins SP-A and SP-D. Each member consists of similar or identical polypeptide chains with a region of collagen-like sequence followed by a C-type lectin domain. The polypeptides associate in threes to form a subunit containing a collagen-like helix, with three clustered lectin domains. These subunits associate into larger structures, usually with 12-18 polypeptides. The collectins bind to patterns of neutral sugars on surfaces (e.g. of micro-organisms) and mediate effector functions associated with killing/phagocytosis. MBL is the only collectin which activates complement. It resembles in quaternary structure the complement protein C1q, which recognizes targets via charge clusters. Binding of MBL to a surface activates MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) attached to MBL, and MASP-2 activates complement proteins C4 and C2. The MASPs are homologous to the C1q-associated proteases, C1r and C1s. MBL therefore activates complement by a mechanism very similar to C1q, and engages the opsonic activity of complement to clear micro-organisms. The serum concentration of MBL is very variable in humans. The variability is largely associated with mutations leading to amino acid substitutions in the collagen-like region which decrease MBL assembly and stability. Many studies demonstrate that MBL deficiency is associated with susceptibility to a range of infectious and inflammatory diseases."}

In both sexes, older subjects had fewer remaining teeth at baseline. Males lost more teeth than females, and edentulism was also more likely in males than in females. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that the number of teeth, number of decayed teeth, periodontal pocket depth, and plaque index were significant predictors for the number of teeth lost. The incidence of edentulism was higher in males than in females. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that poorer mental health status, fewer teeth, having deep periodontal pocket, and poorer oral hygiene status were independently associated with the six-year incidence of edentulism. Tooth loss in institutionalised elderly people in Japan is related to both poor oral health status and poor mental health status."}

Of 11 583 eligible for repeat screening FSG 3 years after an initial negative examination, 9317 (80.4%) returned. Polyp or mass detection in distal colon at year 3 repeat FSG; incidence of adenoma or cancer in distal colon at year 3 examination; determination of reason for detection (increased depth of insertion or improved preparation at the year 3 examination or detection in a previously examined area). A total of 1292 returning participants (13.9%) had a polyp or mass detected by FSG 3 years after the initial examination. In the distal colon, 3.1% (292/9317) were found to have an adenoma or cancer. The incidence of advanced adenoma (n = 72) or cancer (n = 6) in the distal colon was 78 (0.8%) of 9317. Of individuals with advanced distal adenomas detected at the year 3 examination, 80.6% (58/72) had lesions found in a portion of the colon that had been adequately examined at the initial sigmoidoscopy. Repeat FSG 3 years after a negative examination will detect advanced adenomas and distal colon cancer. Although the overall percentage with detected abnormalities is modest, these data raise concern about the impact of a prolonged screening interval after a negative examination."}

Schizophrenic patients (n = 78) were evaluated on neuropsychological tests of attention, short-term- and working memory, learning, long-term memory (retention) and executive function. Data were analyzed according to medication, severity of illness and age. We observed that treatment with atypical antipsychotics compared to conventional neuroleptics was significantly associated with a more favorable effect on cognitive function. Especially in short-term memory and retention a clear advantage of atypical antipsychotics could be seen. Results from this study suggest that even under clinical routine conditions atypical antipsychotics have an advantage on cognitive function when compared with conventional neuroleptics."}

Two catalyst systems were investigated, (SBI)ZrMe2/Al(i)Bu3/[Ph3C][CN[B(C6F5)3]2] (1:100:1) at 25.0 degrees C and (SBI)ZrCl(2)/methylalumoxane at 40.0 degrees C (Al:Zr = 2400:1) (SBI = rac-Me(2)Si(1-Indenyl)2). The aims of the study were to address fundamental mechanistic aspects of metallocene-catalyzed alkene polymerizations, catalyst initiation, the quantitative correlation between catalyst structure and the rate of chain propagation, and the nature of dormant states. One of the most important but largely unknown factors in metallocene catalysis is the distribution of the catalyst between dormant states and species actively involved in polymer chain growth. Measurements of polymer yield Y versus reaction time t for propene concentrations [M] = 0.15-0.59 mol L(-1) and zirconocene concentrations in the range [Zr] = (2.38-9.52) x 10(-5) mol L(-1) for the borate system showed first-order dependence on [M] and [Zr]. Up to t approximately 1 s, the half-life of catalyst initiation is comparable to the half-life of chain growth; that is, this phase is governed by non-steady-state kinetics. We propose a rate law which takes account of this and accurately describes the initial rates. Curve fitting of Y(t) data provides an apparent chain growth rate constant k(p)(app) on the order of 10(3) L mol(-1) s(-1). By contrast, the evolution with time of the number-average polymer molecular weight, which is independent of the concentration of catalyst involved, leads to a k(p) which is an order of magnitude larger, (17.2 +/- 1.4) x 10(3) L mol(-1) s(-1). The ratio k(p)(app)/k(p) = 0.08 indicates that under the given conditions only about 8% of the total catalyst is actively engaged in chain growth at any one time. The system (SBI)ZrCl(2)/methylalumoxane is significantly less active, k(p)(app) = 48.4 +/- 2.7 and k(p) = (6 +/- 2) x 10(2) L mol(-1) s(-1), while, surprisingly, the mole fraction of active species is essentially identical, 8%. Evidently, the energetics of the chain growth sequence are strongly modulated by the nature of the counteranion. Increasing the counteranion/zirconium ratio from 1:1 to 20:1 has no influence on catalyst activity. These findings are consistent with a model of closely associated ion pairs throughout the chain growth sequence. For the borate system, propagation is approximately 6000 times faster than initiation, while for the MAO catalyst, k(p)/k(i) approximately 800. Polymers obtained at 25 degrees C show 0.1-0.2 mol % 2,1-regioerrors, and end-group analysis identifies 2,1-misinsertions as the main cause for chain termination (66%), as compared to 34% for the vinylidene end groups. The results suggest that 2,1-regioerrors are a major contributor to the formation of dormant species, even at short reaction times."}

Here, we summarize the fruits of these advances: innovative approaches to the use of existing, traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs; novel agents approved very recently; and further avenues that are presently under investigation or which are of more distant promise."}

The numbers and percentages of Th2 (CRTH2(+)CD8(-)CD3(+)) and Tc2 (CRTH2(+)CD8(+)) cells were compared between the decidua basalis and decidua parietalis. Th2 and Tc2 cells accumulated in the decidua basalis in normal pregnancy. Accumulation of Tc2 cells and both Th2 and Tc2 cells decreased in the decidua basalis in RSA-A and RSA-N respectively. The number and percentage of Th2, and Tc2 cells in the decidua parietalis were similar in normal pregnancy, RSA-A and RSA-N.

Clinical application of this method has been hampered, as data analysis has not been feasible in real time. Therefore a novel, real-time signal processing technique for inductance cardiography has been developed. Its essential concept consists in performance of multiple tasks by several, logically linked signal processing modules that have access to common databases. Based on these principles, a software application was designed that performs acquisition, display, filtering and ECG-triggered ensemble averaging of inductance signals and separates cardiogenic waveforms from noise related to respiration and other sources. The resulting ventricular volume curves are automatically analysed. Performance of the technique for monitoring cardiac output in real time was compared with thermodilution in four patients in an intensive care unit. The bias (mean difference) among 76 paired thoracocardiographic and thermodilution derived changes in cardiac output was 0%; limits of agreement (+/- 2 SD of the bias) were +/- 25%. It is concluded that the proposed signal processing technique for inductance cardiography holds promise for non-invasive, real-time estimation of changes in cardiac output."}

Bacteriol. 88:473-476. 1964.-Experiments exploring the factors which determine the ability of Coccidioides immitis to survive and reproduce in the soil in situ are described and discussed. Previous work indicated that soil temperatures and salinity influence the growth and distribution of C. immitis. It was thought that these factors might work through enhancing the growth of C. immitis or inhibiting the growth of its possible antagonists, or both. In searching for antagonists, samples of surface soil from an endemic area were screened by standard culture techniques. Three significant antagonists were isolated and were identified as two strains of Bacillus subtilis, and Penicillium janthinellum. Subcultures of each of these isolates were grown on Saboraud's media modified by sodium chloride and calcium chloride in parallel series. The salts used were the predominant salts, and the range of temperature was comparable to that found in the soil. The organisms were grown at 18 to 27 C and at 40 C. The latter temperature approximated the temperature of the top centimeter of soil for 4 to 6 hr a day in the spring when C. immitis is recovered. P. janthinellum was unable to survive 40 C. The growth of the other two, while unaffected by temperature change alone, was inhibited by the salts. Conversely, C. immitis was stimulated by the salts when grown at the higher temperature. These findings support the hypothesis that markedly increased salinity and seasonal high temperature of the surface soil inhibit or kill these antogonists while enhancing the growth of C. immitis."}

The study samples were comprised of 340 ADHD children, 226 unrelated controls and 202 integrated ADHD trios (included proband and biological parents). The polymorphisms consisted of 48 bp VNTR in exon 3 of DRD4, and 40 bp VNTR in the 3' untranslated region of DAT1. Associations of polymorphisms with ADHD and its subtypes were examined by: (i) comparing cases and controls; and (ii) using family-based association study in an extension of exact transmission-disequilibrium test (ETDT) and haplotype-based haplotype relative risk (HHRR). The repeat numbers at the DRD4 48 bp locus ranged from 2-6 repeats in the Han Chinese controls, with the most common being the 4-repeat (77%) and 2-repeat (19.4%) alleles. Neither the 7-repeat allele nor longer repeats were found. For the DAT1, the repeat numbers at the 40 bp locus ranged from 6-7 repeats and 9-11 repeats. The 10-repeat allele was the most frequent (90.7%). The long-repeat alleles of DRD4 (ranging from 4-6 repeats) and DAT1 (ranging from 11-12 repeats), were present more frequently in ADHD probands than in controls. Our primary analyses failed to replicate the associations between ADHD and 7-repeat allele of DRD4 and the 10-repeat allele of DAT1. The long-repeat alleles of DRD4 (after a stratification by gender) and DAT1 may increase the risk for ADHD in Han Chinese children."}

In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that wogonin possesses antioxidant activities and inhibitory effect on tumor cells growth. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of wogonin on telomerase activity and apoptosis of human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780. MTT assay,fluorescent microscopy,and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis were used to determine the role of wogonin on apoptosis of A2780 cells. The telomerase activity of A2780 cells were observed by using TRAP-ELASA method. A2780 cell growth was significantly inhibited by wogonin. The inhibiting effect showed concentration-dependent and time-dependent manners with IC(50) of 85 microg/ml. After treatment with 50 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml wogonin for 48 hours, A2780 cells showed morphological changes associated with the characters of apoptosis under fluorescent microscope. Typical DNA ladder was found using agarose gel electrophoresis. Telomerase activity of A2780 cells was gradually decreased with the increasing of wogonin concentration. When the concentration of wogonin was higher than 200 microg/ml, telomerase activity of A2780 cells was inhibited markedly. Wogonin can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of A2780 cells within a certain concentration range(50-250 microg/ml). Anticancer effects of wogonin were associated with the induction of apoptosis and partly with the suppression of telomerase activity."}

Between October 1985 and August 2002, 1077 renal transplantations were carried out at our center. The incidence of NHL after transplantation was 1.1% (12/1077). All patients had their immunosuppressive doses reduced after they were diagnosed with NHL. Complete remission was achieved in eight cases, and five of these individuals were still alive at the time of writing. The circumstances for each of the three deaths in this group were as follows: (1) progressive gastric adenocarcinoma 9 years after being diagnosed with NHL, (2) stage III NHL cured with chemotherapy, but died of infection 2 years after NHL diagnosis, and (3) recurrent intestinal lymphoma, with death during second line chemotherapy. Of the five survivors in the remission group, one had to return to hemodialysis. The four patients who did not enter remission all died. The median time from transplantation to diagnosis of NHL was 66 months. At the time of writing, the median survival time for the eight patients who achieved complete remission was 41.5 months. The study showed that treatment of localized disease (skin or intestinal NHL) with surgery and/or radiotherapy/chemotherapy leads to complete remission and long survival times; however, patients in remission are at risk for other causes of death."}

The polymer-drug conjugate was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis in human plasma. The polymer showed considerable enzymatic hydrolysis (68% after 48 h). The results showed that the polymeric prodrug model of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) described here can be used in topical formulations of NSAIDs. It is expected that the novel thiol derivative will have both enhanced transdermal penetration and stability to oxidation which make it a suitable candidate for transdermal formulations."}
{"pmid": "12871169", "title": "Immunophilins in nervous system degeneration and regeneration.", "abstract": "Immunophilins are receptors for immunosuppressive drugs like cyclosporin A, FK506, rapamycin and their non- immunosuppressive analogs, which are collectively referred to as \"immunophilin ligands\" (IPL). Cyclosporin A binds to a class of IP called cyclophilins, whereas the receptors for FK506 and rapamycin belong to the family of FK506- binding proteins (FKBP). The latter are designated according to their molecular weight: FKBP12, 25, 52 etc. FKBP levels in the rat brain are up to 50 times higher than in the immune system. FKBP12 is associated with IP3 and ryanodine receptors present on the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in stabilizing calcium release. It has also been proposed to be a modulator of the TGFbeta receptor activity. Crush injury of facial or sciatic nerves in rat leads to markedly increased FKBP12 levels in the respective nerve nuclei and this increase is related to nerve regeneration. Cyclophilin A protects cells from death following expression of mutant Cu/ Zn superoxide dismutase, which is associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our recent studies show that FKBP12 and FKBP52 are expressed in the human nervous system, especially in the substantia nigra- deep gray matter axis. In neurodegenerative diseases, FKBP12 levels increase in neurons situated in areas of pathology. This IP colocalizes with synaptophysin and alpha- synuclein, suggesting that it may become a novel marker of pathology. Immunophilins participate in axonal transport, synaptic vesicle assembly and may play a role in neuroprotection against abnormal protein aggregation, suggesting a potential avenue of therapeutic interventions."}

Human recombinant VEGF(165) was radiolabelled with (123)I by electrophilic radioiodination using the chloramine T method. [(123)I]VEGF(165) was administered intravenously [mean dose 184 +/- 18 MBq (</=130 pmol; </=5 micro g) per patient] to 18 patients with gastrointestinal tumours.

All patients underwent single-photon emission tomography imaging 1.5 h post-injection. Scanning with [(123)I]VEGF(165) was compared with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Intravenous injection of [(123)I]VEGF(165) did not cause any side-effects. Binding of [(123)I]VEGF(165 )to primary tumours and metastases was visible shortly after injection. In patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas, primary tumours were visualised in seven of nine, lymph node metastases in three of four, liver metastases in three of six and lung metastases in one of three. Cholangiocarcinomas were visualised by imaging in one of two patients. Hepatocellular carcinomas were visible by imaging in two of four patients. [(123)I]VEGF(165) scans were weakly positive in one patient with abdominal schwannoma and in one patient with peritoneal carcinosis. These results indicate that scanning with [(123)I]VEGF(165) can visualise gastrointestinal tumours and metastases expressing receptors for VEGF(165).

The addition of immunotherapy, biologic modifiers, and antibody therapy such as rituximab (Rituxan) or radiolabeled antibody to the autologous transplant are approaches undergoing evaluation. Historically, there has been a high regimen-related mortality rate associated with myeloablative allogeneic transplant that has made this approach a less appealing option for therapy. The use of nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplants as treatment for NHL is less well studied and remains to be defined."}

To understand the molecular targets of c-Myc function, we have used an unbiased genome-wide location-analysis approach to examine the genomic binding sites of c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. We find that c-Myc together with its heterodimeric partner, Max, occupy >15% of gene promoters tested in these cancer cells. The DNA binding of c-Myc and Max correlates extensively with gene expression throughout the genome, a hallmark attribute of general transcription factors. The c-Myc/Max heterodimer complexes also colocalize with transcription factor IID in these cells, further supporting a general role for overexpressed c-Myc in global gene regulation. In addition, transcription of a majority of c-Myc target genes exhibits changes correlated with levels of c-myc mRNA in a diverse set of tissues and cell lines, supporting the conclusion that c-Myc regulates them. Taken together, these results suggest a general role for overexpressed c-Myc in global transcriptional regulation in some cancer cells and point toward molecular mechanisms for c-Myc function in malignant transformation."}

It is involved not only in the acquisition of multidrug-resistance phenotypes in cancer cells but also in normal tissues such as the brain, kidneys, liver, and intestines. This transporter has the potential to export unnecessary or toxic exogenous substances or metabolites, and in the intestine it is thought to play a role in limiting the oral absorption of a number of structurally unrelated drugs. In 2000, Hoffmeyer et al. performed a systemic screening for MDR1 polymorphisms and suggested that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 26 of the MDR1 gene (C3435T) was associated with a lower level of intestinal MDR1 expression, and thereby with lower plasma concentrations of digoxin after oral administration. At present, over 20 SNPs have been found in the MDR1 gene. Clinical studies on the effects of C3435T on MDR1 expression and function in the tissues, and consequently on the pharmacokinetics, have been performed worldwide. In this review, the latest reports concerning the relationship of MDR1 genotypes with pharmacokinetics and MDR1 expression are summarized. Our experimental results demonstrate the importance of genetic polymorphisms at positions 3435 and 2677 in the MDR1 gene on pharmacokinetics and intestinal MDR1 expression. In the future, haplotype analysis of the MDR1 gene and subsequent classification of subjects are needed for individualized pharmacotherapy based on MDR1 genotyping."}

For this reason, alternative agents have been developed. Sevelamer (Renagel), GelTex Pharmaceuticals Inc.) is a polymer which has been found to effectively bind phosphorus. It has resulted in a decreased rate of vascular calcification compared to calcium-containing binders. Other agents under development include lanthanum carbonate and iron-complex preparations.

The aim of the present work was to assess a satiety drinking test in the evaluation of accommodation in health and dyspepsia. Twenty five controls and 37 severely dyspeptic patients seen at a tertiary care centre completed a dyspepsia questionnaire, and gastric emptying and gastric barostat studies. The amount of liquid meal ingested at maximum satiety during a slow satiety drinking test was determined. In controls, we studied the influence of caloric density and of pharmacological agents that influence accommodation. In patients, satiety scores were higher and maximum satiety occurred at lower calories (542 (50) v 1508 (53) kcal; p<0.0001). Six patients had required nutritional support, but excluding these did not alter the correlations. With increasing severity of early satiety, less calories were ingested at maximum satiety. In multivariate analysis, the amount of calories was significantly correlated to accommodation but not to gastric emptying or sensitivity. Sensitivity and specificity of the satiety test in predicting impaired accommodation reached 92% and 86%, respectively. At different caloric densities, ingested volume rather than caloric load determined maximum satiety. Pharmacological agents (sumatriptan, cisapride, erythromycin) affected the satiety test according to their effect on accommodation. A slow caloric drinking test can be used to evaluate accommodation and early satiety. It provides a non-invasive method of predicting impaired accommodation and quantifying pharmacological influences on accommodation."}

Transmission, diagnosis and managing suspected cases].", "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease that, in the short period between 1 February and 24 April 2003, has been diagnosed in more than 4000 patients. Its origin was traced to Guandong, a province in southeast China. The culprit organism was identified as a new coronavirus. The clinical presentation is unspecific and includes fever, respiratory symptoms, lymphopenia and pulmonary infiltrates on X-ray. Essential steps to prevent further dissemination of the virus are rapid identification, and treatment in an isolation unit. Despite all the international efforts and the rapid progress in the investigation of SARS coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO), the epidemic has not yet been brought under control."}

To evaluate the efficacy of high-power 50-ms 1064 Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of class I-III lower extremity vessels. Ten female patients (mean age of 39 years) had a 5-cm2 area of veins measuring 0.2 to 3 mm in diameter treated with up to three treatment sessions using a new 1064 Nd:YAG laser, with the end point being 100% vessel clearing after three treatments. Red vessels were treated with a spot size of 1.5 mm, a fluence of 400 to 600 J/cm2, a pulse width of 30 to 50 ms; blue vessels of 1 to 3 mm were treated with a spot size of 3 mm, a fluence of 250 to 370 J/cm2, and a pulse width of 50 to 60 ms. Macrophotographic imaging evaluations by blinded observers using a quartile scale and a patient satisfaction scale were employed to evaluate results. At month 3 after the final treatment session, 20% of all vessel types had 50% to 75% improvement. Equal clearing was noted for blue and red vessels. At month 6, 80% of patients had a greater than 75% clearing. Ninety percent of patients were highly satisfied with the treatment results at 6 months. By varying spot size, fluence, and pulse duration, a long-wavelength 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser can achieve excellent results for treating both blue and red lower extremity vessels that are less than 3 mm in diameter."}

The changes of CO levels and the effects of zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of heme-oxygenase (HO), in endotoxin shock and the efficacy of hemin, an inducer of HO were investigated. The plasma CO levels were found to be significantly increased during the course of endotoxin shock. Injection of ZnPP was shown to abrogate the endotoxin-induced hypotension and metabolic derangements markedly. Administration of hemin to healthy rabbits revealed the hypotension and metabolic derangements similar to the animals given endotoxin. CO is a newly found endogenously produced mediator which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of endotoxin shock."}

In this study, 5 patients with juvenile Niemann-Pick disease were evaluted for sleep abnormalities using nocturnal polysomnography, clinical evaluation, and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. HLA typing and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin levels were also evaluated in 4 patients. Niemann-Pick disease diagnosis was confirmed in all cases biochemically and by the presence of foam cells in the bone marrow. Deterioration of intellectual function; the presence of pyramidal, dystonic and cerebellar features; and splenomegaly were observed in all cases. Cataplexy was reported in 1 patient. Nocturnal polysomnography revealed disrupted sleep in all patients. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, rapid eye movement sleep, and delta sleep amounts were decreased when compared to age-matched controls. Altered sleep patterns included sudden increases in muscle tone during delta sleep, electroencephalographic sigma activity connected with rapid eye movements and muscle atonia, atypical K-complexes and spindle activity, and the presence of alpha-delta sleep. All Niemann-Pick disease cases exhibited fragmentary myoclonus. Shortened mean sleep latencies were observed in 3 patients during the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, but sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods were observed only in the case with cataplexy. This patient was HLA DQB1*0602 positive, while the other subjects were HLA negative. Cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels were reduced in 2 patients (1 with cataplexy) while in the 2 other patients, the levels were at the lower range of the normal values. Hypocretin levels in the Niemann-Pick disease group (204.8 +/- 39.3 pg/mL) were significantly reduced when compared to controls (265.8 +/- 48.8 pg/mL). The findings suggest that lysozomal storage abnormalities in Niemann-Pick disease patients may impact the hypothalamus and, more specifically, hypocretin-containing cells. These changes might be partially responsible for sleep abnormalities and cataplexy in patients with Niemann-Pick disease."}

Its protein product, DSCR1 (Adapt78), also referred to as MCIP1, inhibits intracellular calcineurin, a phosphatase that mediates many cellular responses to calcium. Exposure of human U251 and HeLa cells to hydrogen peroxide led to a rapid hyperphosphorylation of DSCR1 (Adapt78). Inhibitor and agonist studies revealed that a broad range of kinases were not responsible for DSCR1 (Adapt78) hyperphosphorylation, including ERK1/2, although parallel activation of the latter was observed. Phosphorylation of both DSCR1 (Adapt78) and ERK1/2 was attenuated by inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatase, suggesting the common upstream involvement of tyrosine dephosphorylation. The hyperphosphorylation electrophoretic shift in DSCR1 (Adapt78) mobility was also observed with other oxidizing agents (peroxynitrite and menadione) but not nonoxidants. Calcium ionophores strongly induced the levels of both hypo- and hyper-phosphorylated DSCR1 (Adapt78) but did not alter phosphorylation status. Calcium-dependent growth factor- and angiotensin II-stimulation also induced both DSCR1 (Adapt78) species. Phosphorylation of either or both serines in a 13-amino acid peptide made to a calcineurin-interacting conserved region of DSCR1 (Adapt78) attenuated inhibition of calcineurin. These data indicate that DSCR1 (Adapt78) protein is a novel, early stage oxidative stress-activated phosphorylation target and newly identified calcium-inducible protein, and suggest that these response mechanisms may contribute to the known cytoprotective and calcineurin-inhibitory activities of DSCR1 (Adapt78)."}

The relationship between patient exposure to DTCA and the response of clinicians is not well understood. A randomized postal survey of Arizona primary care provider physicians (n = 1080) and physician assistants (n = 704) was conducted. A questionnaire was created using a hypothetical patient scenario that varied according to the diagnosis of the patient (ie, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, seasonal allergies, or obesity) and the type of informational exposure generating the patient's questions (ie, DTCA vs drug references such as Physicians' Desk Reference). Clinicians were randomly assigned 1 of 8 forms of the scenario and were asked standardized questions related to their responses when faced with the patient scenario. The response rate was 44% (40.5% of physicians and 49.3% of physician assistants). No statistically significant differences were found between the early and late responders or between responders and nonresponders. Relative to clinicians who received the \"drug reference book\" patient scenario, clinicians who received the DTCA patient scenario were more likely to become annoyed with a patient for asking for more information about medications (P =.003); less likely to answer the patient's questions (P =.03) or provide additional written information (P =.007); more likely to become frustrated (P =.003) and annoyed (P<.001) with the patient for asking to try a specific medication; and less likely to provide samples (P =.001) or a prescription (P<.001) for a specific medication. Clinicians are amenable to patients asking for drug information and medications, but they are less receptive to questions arising from DTCA."}
{"pmid": "12874444", "title": "Role of galectin-3 in diabetic nephropathy.", "abstract": "The advanced glycosylation end products (AGE) participate in the pathogenesis of nephropathy and other diabetic complications through several mechanisms, including their binding to cell surface receptors. The AGE receptors include RAGE, the macrophage scavenger receptors, OST-48 (AGE-R1), 80K-H (AGE-R2), and galectin-3 (AGE-R3). Galectin-3 interacts with the beta-galactoside residues of cell surface and matrix glycoproteins via the carbohydrate recognition domain and with intracellular proteins via peptide-peptide associations mediated by its N-terminus domain. These structural properties enable galectin-3 to exert multiple functions, including the mRNA splicing activity, the control of cell cycle, the regulation of cell adhesion, the modulation of allergic reactions, and the binding of AGE. The lack of transmembrane anchor sequence or signal peptide suggests that it is associated with other AGE receptors, possibly AGE-R1 and AGE-R2, to form an AGE-receptor complex, rather than playing an independent role. In target tissues of diabetic vascular complications, such as the endothelium and mesangium, galectin-3 is weakly expressed under basal conditions and is markedly upregulated by the diabetic milieu (and to a lesser extent by aging). Galectin-3-deficient mice were found to develop accelerated diabetic glomerulopathy versus the wild-type animals, as evidenced by the more pronounced increase in proteinuria, mesangial expansion, and matrix gene expression. This was associated with a more marked renal/glomerular AGE accumulation, suggesting that it was attributable to the lack of galectin-3 AGE-receptor function. These data indicate that galectin-3 is upregulated under diabetic conditions and is operating in vivo to provide protection toward AGE-induced tissue injury, as opposed to RAGE."}

A total of 212 cases and 422 population controls matched by age, sex, and geographic area were enrolled. In conditional logistic regression analysis, the following factors were found to be independently associated with an increased risk of Campylobacter infection: drinking undisinfected water, eating at barbecues, eating poultry bought raw, having occupational exposure to animals, and eating undercooked pork. The following factors were independently related to a decreased risk: eating mutton, eating raw fruits or berries, and swimming. Results indicated that infection is more likely to occur as a result of cross-contamination from raw poultry products than because of poultry consumption per se. Drinking undisinfected water, reported by 53% of cases, was a leading risk factor in this study. Drinking water may constitute the common reservoir linking infection in humans and animals, including poultry and wild birds. Insight into the ecology of Campylobacter in freshwater ecosystems may be required to understand the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis. The possibility that certain foods confer protection against campylobacteriosis deserves exploration."}

The purpose of this study was to determine the independent contribution of presurgical symptoms of depression to 2-year cardiac mortality after CABG. Eighty-nine consecutive veteran nonemergent CABG patients recruited between December 1996 and June 1998 completed the BDI 1 to 7 days before surgery. Mortality risk was assessed by medical co-morbidity and RIS. Significant univariate contributions to two-year cardiovascular mortality were found for RIS (chi2 = 6.57, p <.01), history of CHF (chi2 = 4.94, p <.02), history of COPD (chi2 = 5.19, p <.02), and elevated depressive symptoms (chi2 = 4.70, p <.03). The multivariate model revealed that the RIS (chi2 = 4.70, p <.03) and elevated depressive symptoms (chi2 = 3.86, p <.05) remained significant in the prediction of 2-year cardiovascular mortality, with no other variables being found significant. Elevated depressive symptoms before CABG surgery appear to be an important independent contributor to long-term mortality. Future research should focus on replication with larger, more diverse samples, and identification of pathophysiological mechanisms."}

The resulting curve was calibrated using the [11C]flumazenil concentration in three of the six samples. The curve peak was recovered by adding an exponential function to the scaled curve whose parameters were estimated from simultaneous fittings of several tissue TACs assuming that all regions share the same input. Good agreement was found between the image-derived and the experimental plasma curves in six subjects. Distribution volumes were highly correlated with linear regression slope and intercept values between [0.94, 1.03] and [-0.10, 0.16], respectively.

The survival characteristics of this strain in the experiments performed (soil at -5, -100, and -1,500 kPa matric potential and artificial groundwater) were indistinguishable from the wild-type strain. Evaluation of potential luminescence was found to be a rapid, cheap, and quantitative measure of viable E. coli O157:H7 Tn5 luxCDABE populations in environmental samples. In the survival studies, bioluminescence of the starved populations of E. coli O157:H7 Tn5 luxCDABE could be reactivated to the original levels of light emission, suggesting that these populations remain viable and potentially infective to humans. The attributes of the construct offer a cheap and low-risk substitute to the use of verocytotoxin-producing E. coli O157:H7 in long-term survival studies."}

We previously observed that the OMgp gene locus on chromosome 17 could be associated with autism, a developmental disorder. The aim of the present study was to characterise the developmental expression of OMgp mRNA in the central nervous system. First we determined the rat OMgp gene sequence and compared it with the human and mouse sequences. Several regions, putative sites for the fixation of transcription factors, are conserved between these three species in the unique intron of this gene. Using quantitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we studied OMgp gene expression in rat brain during post-natal development. We found that OMgp mRNA expression was developmentally regulated, with a peak of expression in the late stages of myelination. We observed a similar profile in oligodendrocyte cultures, in absence of neurones, suggesting that OMgp mRNA expression by oligodendrocytes was independent of axonal influence. Our observations suggest that OMgp is a late marker of myelination, which could be implicated in the arrest of oligodendrocyte proliferation, arrest of myelination or compaction of myelin."}

Although it has been reported that chitosan promotes osteogenesis in bone lesions, little is known about how chitosan modulates this process. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of water-soluble chitosan relative to initiation of biologic mineralization, especially in the matrix-vesicles-(MVs) mediated process in vitro. A human osteoblastic cell line (NOS-1) was used. After 3 days of incubation, the number of cells and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity increased significantly in the chitosan group. RT-PCR analysis revealed that chitosan induced an increase in the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 mRNA after 7 days of incubation. MVs were isolated from NOS-1 cells using a collagenase digestion and ultracentrifugation method. ALP activity of MVs isolated from chitosan-supplemented cells was significantly higher than that of the control group. Furthermore, isolated MVs were incubated in medium supplemented with Na-beta-glycerophosphate without fetal bovine serum. Needle-like crystals were observed in association with MVs after 24 h of incubation. These needle-like crystals were densely accumulated in the chitosan group. The present findings suggest that water-soluble chitosan would promote osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and may be useful for the acceleration of initial biologic mineralization."}

The low toxicity profile, relative ease of administration, and encouraging response rates observed as a single agent allow it to be used alone or in combination with or following standard chemotherapies. Patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) have a high response rate to treatment with this new modality, with overall response rates of 50% to 60% in the relapsed setting and 70% in the initial setting. The addition of scheduled retreatment or maintenance therapy leads to improved clinical responses and delays time to progression. Combination trials with chemotherapy demonstrate feasibility and promising response rates including clearing of minimal residual disease detected using molecular techniques. To date, there are limited randomized clinical trial data available to guide the use of this new modality in this patient population and few long-term results. It remains difficult to determine when and how to use this new modality best in the overall treatment course of these patients. This paper discusses the rationale for the use of rituximab in patients with follicular NHL and discusses the available data involving dosing, schedule, timing, and combinations with chemotherapy."}

Descriptive clinical research. Competitive games of the Swedish Elite Ice Hockey League and the Swedish Elite Basketball League. Twenty-six male ice hockey players (from two teams) and 18 basketball players (from two teams). None. S-100B and NSE were analyzed using two-site immunoluminometric assays. The numbers of acceleration/deceleration events were assessed from videotape recordings of the games. Head trauma-related symptoms were monitored 24 hours after the game using the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire. Changes in serum concentrations of S-100B (postgame - pregame values) were statistically significant after both games (ice hockey, 0.072 +/- 0.108 microg/L, P = 0.00004; basketball, 0.076 +/- 0.091 microg/L, P = 0.001). In basketball, there was a significant correlation between the change in S-100B (postgame-pregame values) and jumps, which were the most frequent acceleration/deceleration (r = 0.706, P = 0.002). For NSE, no statistically significant change in serum concentration was found in either game. For one ice hockey player who experienced concussion during play, S-100B was increased more than for the other players. S-100B was released into the blood of the players as a consequence of game-related activities and events. Analysis of the biochemical brain damage markers (in particular S-100B) seems to have the potential to become a valuable additional tool for assessment of the degree of brain tissue damage in sport-related head trauma and probably for decision making about returning to play."}

The extract was concentrated, washed with dichloromethane for defatting, and cleaned up on Bond Elut C18, PSA and ACCUCAT cartridge-columns, and then AA was determined by LC/MS in the selected ion recording (SIR) mode. For the LC/MS analysis, four LC columns were connected in-line and the flow of the mobile phase was switched according to a time-program. Monitoring ions for AA were m/z 72 and 55, and those for AA-1-(13)C were m/z 73 and 56. AA and AA-1-(13)C were determined without interference from the matrices in all samples. The recoveries of AA from potato chips, corn snack, pretzel and roasted tea spiked at the level of 500 ng/g of AA were 99.5-101.0% with standard deviations (SD) in the range from 0.3 to 1.6%. The limits of detection and quantification of the developed method were 9 and 30 ng/g for AA in samples, respectively. The method was applied to the analysis of AA in various processed or cooked food samples purchased from retail markets. High levels of AA were found in potato chips and French-fried potato (467-3,544 ng/g). Fried and sugar-coated dough cakes (karinto) contained 374 and 1,895 ng/g. Corn snacks contained 117-535 ng/g of AA. Roasted foods (such as roasted sesame seed, roasted barley (mugi-cha), roasted tea (hoji-cha), coffee beans and curry powder) contained 116-567 ng/g of AA. Foods made from fish, egg and meat contained lower levels of AA than the plant-based foods. Foods containing much water showed a tendency to have low levels of AA compared with dry foods. The proposed method was applicable to the analysis of AA in variety of processed foods."}

However, most remain oblivious of the short- and long-term implications of the morbid conditions associated with middle and old age, simply because of lack of awareness, and the unavailability or ever-increasing cost of the medical and social support systems.

The MpFtsZ1 and MpFtsZ2 proteins are predicted to localize in chloroplasts. Genomic Southern analysis suggested that each ftsZ gene is a single-copy nuclear gene. Northern analysis confirmed that both genes are active. A phylogenetic tree constructed with the deduced MpFtsZ amino acid sequences suggests that MpFtsZ1 and MpFtsZ2 can be classified into the plant chloroplastic FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 families, respectively. This result suggests that two ftsZ families exist universally in land plants. The determination of the intron structures of both MpftsZ genes supported this hypothesis. The transformation of a sense MpftsZ2 overexpression construct into M. polymorpha produced a large chloroplast phenotype in a transgenic plant. The mean number of chloroplasts was 38.2 (standard deviation, 21.4; n = 200) in epidermal cells of wild-type plants, whereas the mean number of chloroplasts was 7.4 (standard deviation, 4.4; n = 200) in the transgenic plant. Southern analysis showed that the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter- MpftsZ2 construct was inserted in at least three positions. Northern analysis suggested that the high accumulation of MpftsZ2 mRNA blocked plastid division. Determination of the chlorophyll content and the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters suggested that the macrochloroplasts function like chloroplasts in wild-type plants under normal light conditions. However, the transgenic plant grew more slowly than did wild-type plants."}

Within the accumbens, there appear to be specific areas in which limbic afferent fibres, derived from the hippocampus and the amygdala, overlap. These afferent inputs have been suggested to converge monosynaptically on cells within the accumbens and are hypothesized to play a role in paradigms such as conditioned place preference. Convergence between inputs from basolateral amygdala and hippocampus can be demonstrated with electrophysiological recording methods, but these do not conclusively preclude polysynaptic mechanisms. We examined the synaptic input to the projection neurons of the accumbens, the medium-sized densely spiny neurons. We labelled the projection neurons with a small injection of biotinylated dextran amine into the accumbens, and the afferents from the basolateral amygdala and ventral subiculum of the hippocampus with injections of biotinylated dextran amine and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin respectively, and revealed the anterogradely labelled fibres with different chromogens. The labelled accumbens-projection neurons were studied with correlated light and electron microscopy for identified monosynaptic inputs. With this technique we have demonstrated anatomically that monosynaptic convergence between the ventral subicular region of the hippocampus and the basolateral region of the amygdala occurs at the level of the proximal as well as distal dendrites. Finally, we suggest that these anatomical arrangements may represent the framework for the integrative role that has been assigned to the accumbens."}

The correlation between these changes and the action of the azoproteins on clearing factor lipase provides further evidence for the importance of this enzyme in fat transport mechanisms. 4-Arsonophenylazoprotein is powerfully inhibitory to the lipase. 4-Carboxy- and 4-sulfonophenylazoprotein in vivo initially inhibit the enzyme and later produce a heparin-like activation."}

We reviewed our database to obtain echocardiograms with normal findings in this age group. The peak early and late mitral filling velocities, the early and late velocity-time integral (VTI), the mitral deceleration time, and the atrial filling fraction (late VTI/total VTI) were measured. PAP was obtained from the peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity. Of 252 echocardiograms performed on patients > or = 90 years old, 47 (19%) were normal. The mean +/- SD values were: ratio of peak early and late mitral filling velocities, 0.69 +/- 0.16; deceleration time, 240 milliseconds +/- 31; ratio of early and late VTI, 1.0 +/- 0.3; atrial filling fraction, 47% +/- 7; and PAP, 31 mm Hg +/- 6. Left ventricular filling in patients aged 90 to 100 years demonstrates increasingly impaired left ventricular relaxation from patients in their eighth and ninth decades. PAP continues to increase with age and PAP < or = 40 mm Hg in the elderly could be considered normal."}

The linear range for the determination of fluoride is between 1.00 x 10(-2)-1.00 x 10(-7) mol L(-1), and the detection limit of the method is 1.0 ng mL(-1). The advantage of this method is that it is free from the use of TISAB solution while being, time-saving and labor-saving. A mechanism study of the activation of FISE in HClO4 medium is explained. The method has been used for the determination of trace fluoride in milk and flour with satisfactory results."}

New therapeutic strategies are under intensive research for patients who do not meet patient selection criteria for transplantation or who suffer from donor organ shortage. Even though there are significant developments in the medical treatment of cardiac failure, the prognosis of this condition continues to be poor. The 20-40% of the candidates for cardiac transplantation die while they are included in the waiting list. Twenty percent mortality has been reported within the first year of transplantation with additional yearly mortality of 5% following the first year. Financial constraints, complications of immunosuppression and functional failure of the transplanted hearts are other limiting factors. This has brought up the necessity to search for alternative surgical treatment methods besides increasing the waiting periods of transplant candidates. The aim of this report is to summarize other currently available therapeutic alternatives for patients with end-stage cardiac disease."}

Gastric tissue levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), 6-keto-PGF1alpha, and PGE2 were transiently increased 30 min after WIR. These increases were significantly inhibited by subcutaneous injection of capsazepine (CPZ), a vanilloid receptor antagonist, and by functional denervation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons induced by the administration of high-dose capsaicin. The administration of capsaicin (orally) and CGRP (intravenously) significantly enhanced the WIR-induced increases in the gastric tissue level of prostaglandins 30 min after WIR, whereas CGRP-(8-37), a CGRP receptor antagonist, significantly inhibited them. Pretreatment with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nonselective inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), and that with indomethacin inhibited the WIR-induced increases in gastric tissue levels of prostaglandins, whereas either pretreatment with aminoguanidine (AG), a selective inhibitor of the inducible form of NOS, or that with NS-398, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, did not affect them. CPZ, the functional denervation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons, and CGRP-(8-37) significantly increased gastric MPO activity and exacerbated the WIR-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats subjected to 4-h WIR. The administration of capsaicin and CGRP significantly increased the gastric tissue levels of prostaglandins and inhibited both the WIR-induced increases in gastric MPO activity and gastric mucosal injury 8 h after WIR. These effects induced by capsaicin and CGRP were inhibited by pretreatment with L-NAME and indomethacin but not by pretreatment with AG and NS-398. These observations strongly suggest that capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons might release CGRP, thereby increasing the gastric tissue levels of PGI2 and PGE2 by activating COX-1 through activation of the constitutive form of NOS in rats subjected to WIR. Such activation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons might contribute to the reduction of WIR-induced gastric mucosal injury mainly by inhibiting neutrophil activation."}

As long-term graft survival rates have improved, an increasing number of grafts are being lost to chronic rejection (CR). We studied the incidence of CR and identified risk factors. We retrospectively analyzed all cadaver pancreas transplants performed at the University of Minnesota between June 19, 1994, and December 31, 2002. We determined the causes of graft loss, the incidence of graft loss to CR and, using multivariate techniques, the major risk factors for CR. A total of 914 cadaver pancreas transplants were performed in the following three categories: simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) (n=321), pancreas after kidney (PAK) (n=389), and pancreas transplant alone (PTA) (n=204). The mean recipient age was 41.3 years and the mean donor age was 30.1 years. Of the 914 pancreas grafts, 643 (70.3%) continue to function (mean length of follow-up, 39 months). The most common cause of graft loss was technical failure, accounting for 118 (12.9%) of the failed grafts. The second most common cause was CR, accounting for 80 (8.8%) of the failed grafts. The incidence of graft loss to CR was highest for PTA (n=23 [11.3%]) and PAK (n=45 [11.6%]) recipients and lowest for SPK recipients (n=12 [3.7%]) (P=0.002). By multivariate analysis, the most significant risk factors for graft loss to CR were a previous episode of acute rejection (relative risk [RR]=4.41, P<0.0001), an isolated (vs. simultaneous) transplant (PAK or PTA [vs. SPK], RR=3.02, P=0.002), cytomegalovirus infection posttransplant (RR=2.41, P=0.001), a retransplant (versus primary transplant) (RR=2.27, P=0.004), and one or two (vs. zero) antigen mismatches at the B loci (RR=1.68, P=0.04). As short-term pancreas transplant results improve and as isolated (PAK or PTA) pancreas transplants gain in popularity, CR will become increasingly common as a cause of pancreas graft loss."}

The growth of the recipient and incidence of graft-versus-host disease depend on graft length. A larger graft may affect the host immune system, but little is known about how the length of the intestinal graft severely affects surgical intervention. We developed a cervical small bowel transplantation (SBT) rat model that minimized technical variations using a cuff method and studied the effects of graft length on surgical damage in SBT. We transplanted a whole (70 cm) or partial (15 cm) intestine into a syngeneic rat combination of LEW (MHC haplotype: RT1(l)) to LEW and evaluated changes in perioperative hemodynamics and the endogenous endotoxin level. Natural killer (NK) cell activity in the peripheral blood and the immunologic response of the recipient spleen were also studied. In the whole SBT model, body weight loss was more severe than in the segmental SBT model; the rats in the former model often died, while all in the latter survived indefinitely. The systemic blood pressure markedly decreased in the whole SBT group immediately after reperfusion. The proliferative activity of splenic lymphocytes stimulated by concanavalin A was also more severely inhibited in the former model than in the latter postoperatively. NK cell activity in the whole SBT rats declined more severely than the segmental SBT rats 3 days postoperatively. The longer graft severely induced surgical intervention; and influenced host immunosuppression, resulting in the higher mortality in rats undergoing whole SBT."}

The aim of the following retrospective study was to show the clinical significance and efficiency of an innovative laser lithotripsy system for urinary stone treatment. Between November 1998 and October 1999, 48 patients were treated with the innovative frequency- doubled double-pulse Neodym: YAG laser lithotripter FREDDY. A total of 50 renal units were treated, 43 ureteroscopically, four ureterorenoscopically, three percutaneous-nephroscopically, and one bladder stone cystoscopically. With a median laser operation time of 5 min (range: 1-30 min) and a total procedure duration of 60 min (range: 15-180 min), a stone-free rate of upper ureteral stones of 62%, middle ureteral stones of 91% and distal ureteral stones of 100% were documented on the first day after treatment. In an observation period of 6 months, no complications were seen. In our experience Laser lithotripsy with FREDDY is an effective, simple and reliable method for the treatment of ureteral stones, with low purchase and maintenance costs. The extremely thin and highly flexible quartz fibre may extend the endoscopic spectrum to otherwise poorly accessible upper ureteral stones, the renal pelvis and renal calix stones. Therefore, a prospective validation study for comparison with ballistic lithotriptors is of great interest."}

Rabbits were exposed to five FiO2 conditions: 21% (control); 15%/6 h; 15%/24 h; 8%/6 h and 8%/24 h. D2- and D1-R mRNA expression levels were calculated for each hypoxia condition relative to control using RT-PCR analysis. In the CB of 1-day-old rabbits, D2- and D1-R transcript levels increased and decreased after exposure to 15 and 8% O2, respectively. In the adult CB, D2- and D1-R transcript levels decreased independently of hypoxia intensities. Only changes in D1-R mRNA levels were dependent on exposure time. In the PG, both hypoxia intensities decreased the D2-R transcript levels in 1-day-old and adult rabbits; but for the D1-R mRNA levels, hypoxia decreased its level in 1-day-old rabbits and increased it in adults regardless of exposure duration. In the SCG, hypoxia had no determinant effect on the D2-R mRNA levels either in newborn or adult rabbits while it induced a decrease of D1-R transcript levels in 1-day-old rabbits and an increase in adult rabbits. It is concluded that hypoxia affects DA D2- or D1-R mRNA levels in the chemoreflex pathway in an age-dependent and site-specific manner."}

The roles of KATP channels in these two actions were to be explored. Isolated hearts from IH and normoxic rats were subjected to 30 min global ischemia followed by 30 min reperfusion. Cardiac function was less deteriorated during ischemia and reperfusion in the IH rat hearts compared to normoxia rat hearts. Amplitude of the maximal contracture during ischemia was lower, while time to maximal contracture was extended in IH hearts. Post-ischemic recovery of left ventricular developed pressure and +/-dP/dtmax were higher in IH hearts than in normoxic hearts. KATP antagonist glibenclamide (10 microM) completely abolished these protective effects of IH, but had no appreciable influence on normoxic hearts. In cardiomyocytes isolated from normoxic hearts, [Ca2+]i, measured as arbitrary units of fluorescence ratio (340 nm/380 nm) of fura-2, gradually increased during 20 min simulated ischemia and kept at high level during 30 min reperfusion (1.081 +/- 0.004 and 1.088 +/- 0.006 respectively, p<0.01 vs pre-ischemia perfusion). However, in cardiomyocytes isolated from IH hearts, [Ca2+]i kept at normal level during ischemia and reperfusion (1.012 +/- 0.006 and 1.021 +/- 0.002 respectively, P>0.05 vs pre-ischemia perfusion). 10 microM glibenclamide and 100 microM 5-hydroxydecanoate (a selective mitochondria KATP antagonist) respectively abolished this effect of IH; calcium overloading reappeared during ischemia (1.133 +/- 0.007 and 1.118 +/- 0.007 respectively, P<0.01) and reperfusion (1.091 +/- 0.004 and 1.095 +/- 0.012 respectivly, P<0.01). However they had no effects on simulated ischemia and reperfusion-induced calcium overloading in normoxic myocytes. 50 microM pinacidil, a KATP opener, attenuated calcium overloading during ischemia and reperfusion in normoxic myocytes, but had no effect on [Ca2+]i change in IH myocytes. These results suggested that KATP channels contributed to the cardiac protection induced by IH against ischemia/reperfusion injury; the elimination of calcium overloading during ischemia/reperfusion by IH might underlie the mechanism of protection."}

Observations aimed at the determination of the alterations in leaf structure and function associated with differential growth and adaptation of plants. Raising elevation results in a progressive decrease of plant height. During the growing period, summer plants are taller than spring and autumn plants at all elevations examined. In high-altitude populations (O. vulgare ssp. vulgare), the blade size becomes reduced in June leaves as compared with October leaves, while it does not change remarkably in low-altitude populations (O. vulgare ssp. hirtum). Leaf thickness remains more or less stable during the growing period. Expanded leaves in June and October at 200 m elevation contain dark phenolics only in their epidermis, whereas leaves of August are densely filled with phenolics in all of their tissues. In June at 1760 m elevation, leaves are devoid of phenolics, which, however, occur in the epidermis of the leaves in August and October. At higher altitudes, larger mesophyll chloroplasts with more starch grains are present in June leaves, whereas in August and October leaves chloroplasts are smaller with fewer starch grains. Leaf stomata and non-glandular hairs increase in number from the lowland to the upland habitats, whereas glandular hairs decrease in number. During the growing season, the density of stomata and of glandular and non-glandular hairs progressively increases. In the low- and mid-altitude oregano populations, leaf chlorophyll a content and PSII activity significantly increase in October, whereas they simultaneously decrease in the high-altitude population, suggesting a phenomenon of chilling-induced photoinhibition. The highest photochemical efficiency of PSII appears in the mid-altitude population (having characteristics intermediate between those of O. vulgare ssp. hirtum and ssp. vulgare) where environmental conditions are more favourable. This conclusion is also confirmed by the observation that the 950 m O. vulgare population has larger and thicker leaves with highly developed palisade and spongy parenchymas."}
{"pmid": "14513868", "title": "Time, space and hippocampal functions.", "abstract": "The hippocampus is one of the most researched structures of the brain. Studies of lesions in humans, primates and rodents have suggested to some that the primary role of the hippocampus is to act as a temporary memory buffer which is required for the consolidation of long-term memory. The famous case study of patient H.M., in particular, seemed to suggest that the hippocampus was of crucial importance for memory formation. However, recordings of single neurons in freely moving rodents did not support this notion. In such recordings, neurons were found that were active predominately when the animal passed through a particular area in space. Consequently, these neurons were termed 'place cells' and a theory was developed that suggested that the hippocampus acts as a 'cognitive map' that is required for spatial orientation. It was then found that H.M. had significant damage to his temporal lobes that included the amygdala, rhinal cortices, and other areas. Further case studies and selective hippocampal lesions in primates resulted in much milder amnestic symptoms, and lesions of defined cortical areas in the temporal lobes showed that a number of functions previously attributed to the hippocampus were in fact linked to these areas. Further analysis of neuronal activity in the hippocampus showed that not only is spatial information represented there, but also additional information, such as speed of movement, direction of movement, match or non-match detection, olfactorial identification, and others. In addition, it was found that selective lesions of the hippocampus in rodents impaired spatial navigation and memory formation only mildly. Only simultaneous lesions of several cortical areas in conjunction with the hippocamus could reproduce the impairments and symptoms that were previously thought to be observed after hippocampal lesions alone. In conclusion it is proposed that information processing and memory formation is shared by several brain areas that act as a functional system. This review presents evidence from many different studies that the hippocampus is part of this system and plays a supportive role in associating complex multimodal information and laying down new memory traces. In addition, the concept of allocating specific functions (such as the development of a cognitive map) exclusively to the hippocampus is rejected."}

The study was based on 12 performance indicators, two self-administered questionnaires (which included internal consistency tests), formal and informal, check interviews in the work place, and direct observations of the DHM. The DHM investigated were found to be particularly weak in systems management (community involvement and intersectoral co-operation), monitoring activities and the systematic organization of meetings. They were rarely involved in the identification of priority health problems or of high-risk groups, and failed to use health-service indicators sufficiently for the analysis of the district health system. The managers were stronger in relation to the organization of technical meetings and the development and implementation of local health plans. Factors associated with good management performance were a favourable organizational structure (including written job descriptions and support from the authorities), 'decision power' (i.e. the ability to select and appoint new staff ) and a good knowledge of the local situation. In Latin America, at least, DHM need to be better prepared, supervised and supported."}

When gallstones are absent or other abnormalities as a potential cause of similar pain do not exist, a different approach is necessary. Although trans-abdominal ultrasound can detect stones down to 3-5 mm, the advent of endoscopic ultrasound provides an even better definition for microlithiasis of < 3 mm. Duodenal aspiration of bile can further detect cholesterol microlithiasis or bilirubin granules, another potential source of biliary-type pain and perhaps even pancreatitis. Only in this way can acalculous gallbladder disease be clearly defined. The percentage of cholecystokinin-stimulated gallbladder emptying has been reputed to be the most sensitive diagnostic test for 'biliary dyskinesia', but abnormality of gallbladder emptying can be due to a smooth muscle defect of the gallbladder itself or heightened tone in the sphincter of Oddi. The value of surgical intervention has not been clearly established. The advent of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, has increased the number of patients with acalculous biliary disease who undergo surgery. Surgery is best done using impaired gallbladder emptying as the criterion for operation with improved outcome. Often, following cholecystectomy, biliary pain does not resolve the so-called 'post cholecystectomy syndrome'. Absence of the gallbladder as a pressure reservoir leaves the sphincter of Oddi as the prime determinant of bile duct pressure. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction also exists in patients with an intact biliary tract and may become evident following cholecystectomy. Biliary manometry has clarified who might benefit from sphincterotomy. Choledochoscintigraphy is a non-invasive preliminary test. Advent of visceral hypersensitivity and better definition of this entity has shown, that in some of these patients with type III sphincter of Oddi, dysfunction appears to reside in duodenal hyperalgesia. It is clear that improved criteria are required to perform gallbladder emptying and better techniques to detect visceral hypersensitivity. Nonetheless, functional biliary pain in the absence of gallstone disease is a definite entity and a challenge for clinicians."}

However, the early kinetics of the TNF response during infection defined an extremely narrow window of opportunity during which anti-TNF therapeutics are efficacious, hampering clinical development for severe sepsis. Because death from severe sepsis often occurs as a late phenomenon, we began a search began for putative \"late\" mediators that could be targeted after the onset of infection. We have now identified high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) as a late mediator of endotoxemia and sepsis. HMGB1 is released by activated macrophages, induces the release of other proinflammatory mediators, and mediates lethality when overexpressed. Administration of anti-HMGB1 antibodies inhibit systemic inflammation, even in established cases, because HMGB1 activity is elevated at significantly later time points than TNF or interleukin-1. It will now be important to determine whether this wider window of activity can be translated into therapeutic advantage for human inflammatory disease."}

The present study was conducted to determine whether higher PKC activity could be due to altered expression of some of the PKC isoforms in the superficial cortex (rich in PTs) of old rats. Fluorimetric measurement showed almost twofold increase in the PKC activities in homogenates and membranes of old (24 mo) compared with adult (6 mo) rats. Interestingly, in the basal state PKC-betaI was overexpressed in the membranes, whereas PKC-delta expression was increased in the cytosol of old compared with adult rats. Treatment of the cortical slices with either SKF-38393, a D1-like agonist, or PDBu, a direct activator of PKC, caused translocation of PKC-betaI from cytosol to membranes in adult but not in old rats. Both of these drugs caused translocation of PKC-delta from membranes to cytosol in adult but not in old rats. These drugs had no effect on translocation of PKC-zeta in both adult and old rats. Both PKC-betaI and -delta co-immunoprecipitated with alpha1-subunit of Na-K-ATPase in adult and old rats. These observations suggest that both SKF-38393 and PDBu differentially regulate PKC-betaI and -delta in adult but not in old rats. Also, PKC-betaI and -delta seem to interact with Na-K-ATPase in these animals. The overexpression of both PKC-betaI and -delta in old rats could be responsible for a higher basal PKC activity, which causes the hyperphosphorylation of Na-K-ATPase and contributes to the diminished inhibition of Na-K-ATPase activity by dopamine in old rats."}

The serotype-specific B-cell epitope of Ab4 was identified further from a random phage-displayed peptide library; selected phage clones reacted specifically with Ab4 and did not react with other mAbs. Immunopositive phage clones displayed a consensus motif, His-Arg/Lys-Leu/Ile, and a synthetic peptide corresponding to the phage-displayed peptide bound specifically to Ab4. The His and Arg residues in this epitope were found to be crucial for peptide binding to Ab4 and binding activity decreased dramatically when these residues were changed to Leu. The epitope-based synthetic peptide not only identified serum samples from DEN-2-immunized mice and rabbits by ELISA but also differentiated clearly between serum samples from DEN-2- and Japanese encephalitis virus-immunized mice. This mAb and its epitope-based peptide antigen will be useful for serologic diagnosis of DEN-2 infection. Furthermore, DEN-2 epitope identification makes it feasible to dissect antibody responses to DEN and to address the role of antibodies in the pathogenesis of primary and secondary DEN-2 infections."}

Yet, many epidemiologic studies measure leisure activity only, without assessment of occupational activity. The purposes of this study were to describe occupational activity and to quantify the association between occupational and leisure activity in 2991 African American and 8566 White middle-aged adults. Physical activity was measured by the Baecke questionnaire in 1987-89 for participants 45 to 64 years of age in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Reported occupational activity was greater among African American men and women compared to White men and women. Leisure activity was greater among White men and women compared to African American men and women. Work indices (range-1 (low) to 5 (high)) were highest among African American women (2.78) and men (2.72), followed by White men (2.55) and women (2.45), adjusted for age, study center, body mass index, and perceived health status. Those with the highest occupational activity had lower participation in any sport or exercise than those with lower occupational activity across race-gender groups. This data suggests that studies relying solely on leisure activity may miss important information provided by occupational physical activity."}

A metastable liquid (ML) is discovered to exist only at low temperatures and is distinct (and may be disjoint) from the supercooled liquid (SCL) that exists only at high temperatures. The free volume plays a significant role in that the spinodals of the ML and SCL merge and then disappear as the free volume is reduced. The Kauzmann temperature T(K) occurs in the ML without any singularity. At T(MC)>T(K), the ML specific heat has a peak. For infinitely long polymers, the peak height diverges and the free volume vanishes at T(MC), resulting in a continuous liquid-liquid transition. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, both T(K) and T(MC) occur in the ML and not in the SCL."}

These findings prompted a collaborative research study aimed at linking such human findings with evidence of food chain contamination in the area. An international team carried out analyses of organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) on samples of 12 foods commonly produced and consumed in Karakalpakstan. Analysis consistently detected long-lasting organochlorine pesticides and their metabolites in all foods of animal origin and in some vegetables such as onions and carrots--two low-cost components of many traditional dishes. Levels of PCBs were relatively low in all samples except fish. Analyses revealed high levels of PCDDs and PCDFs (together often termed \"dioxins\") in sheep fat, dairy cream, eggs, and edible cottonseed oil, among other foodstuffs. These findings indicate that food traditionally grown, sold, and consumed in Karakalpakstan is a major route of human exposure to several persistent toxic contaminants, including the most toxic of dioxins, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). Intake estimations demonstrate that consumption of even small amounts of locally grown food may expose consumers to dioxin levels that considerably exceed the monthly tolerable dioxin intake levels set by the World Health Organization. Data presented in this study allow a first assessment of the risk associated with the consumption of certain food products in Karakalpakstan and highlight a critical public health situation."}

The conditionally immortalized rat retinal pericyte cell lines (TR-rPCTs), which express a temperature-sensitive large T-antigen, were obtained from two tsA58 Tg rats. These cell lines had a multicellular nodule morphology and reacted positively with von Kossa staining, a marker of calcification. TR-rPCTs cells expressed mRNA of pericyte markers such as rat intercellular adhesion molecule-1, platelet-derived growth factor-receptor beta, angiopoietin-1, and osteopontin. Western blot analysis indicated that alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) was expressed in TR-rPCT3 and 4 cells. In contrast, alpha-SMA was induced by transforming growth factor-beta1 and its enhancement was reduced by basic fibroblast growth factor in TR-rPCT1 and 2 cells. When TR-rPCT1 cells were cultured with a rat retinal endothelial cell line (TR-iBRB2) in a contact co-culture system, the number of TR-iBRB2 cells were significantly reduced in comparison with that of a single culture of TR-iBRB2 cells, suggesting that physical contact between pericytes and retinal endothelial cells is important for the growth of retinal endothelial cells. In conclusion, conditionally immortalized retinal pericyte cell lines were established from tsA58 Tg rats. These cell lines exhibited the properties of retinal pericytes and can be applied in co-culture systems with a retinal capillary endothelial cell line."}

The diagnosis of dyslipidemia was established when the serum cholesterol value (CHO) was more than 240 mg/dL or serum triglycerides (TG) were more than 200 mg/dL. Generalized estimating equations and mixed-modeling procedures were used for statistical analyses. Hypercholesterolemia was observed in 46% to 80% and hypertriglyceridemia in 43% to 78% of sirolimus-treated patients during the first 6 posttransplantation months. The mean peak serum lipid levels among patients in the sirolimus group (CHO=285.5 mg/dL; TG=322.4 mg/dL) were significantly higher than those in the nonsirolimus group (CHO=250.2 mg/dL and TG=267.6 mg/dL; both P<0.01). The lipid values, which were persistently elevated during the first posttransplantation year, decreased slowly thereafter but remained significantly higher than the pretransplantation levels beyond 4 years after transplantation. The two forms of hyperlipidemia tended to occur in parallel (Pearson's coefficient of correlation, r=0.5, P<0.001), showing a positive predictive value of 0.67 and a negative predictive value of 0.65. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events within 4 years after transplantation among patients treated with versus without sirolimus. The dyslipidemia associated with sirolimus therapy, albeit persistent, does not seem to represent a major risk factor for the early emergence of cardiovascular complications."}

PHM are diandric triploids while almost all CHM are androgenetic. Thus the characteristic trophoblastic hyperplasia seen in both CHM and PHM is usually associated with the presence of two paternal genomes. Very occasionally CHM may be diploid, but biparental, in origin. These rare BiCHM are found in patients with recurrent HM and appear to be associated with an autosomal recessive condition predisposing to molar pregnancies. Since they are pathologically indistinguishable from androgenetic CHM, BiCHM are also likely to result from defects in genomic imprinting. There is evidence that the gene mutated in this condition, provisionally mapped to 19q13.3-13.4, may be important in setting the maternal imprint in the ovum. Women with BiCHM have a much higher risk of recurrent HM than women with AnCHM and an appreciable risk of persistent trophoblastic disease. Investigation of these unusual BiCHM and isolation of the defective gene will lead to a greater understanding of the function of genomic imprinting in early development."}

Thus, we have compared the effect of temperature (5-80 degrees C) on the RP-HPLC (C8 or cyano columns) elution behaviour of mixtures of peptides encompassing amphipathic alpha-helical structure, amphipathic alpha-helical structure with L- or D-substitutions or non-amphipathic alpha-helical structure. By comparing the retention behaviour of the helical peptides to a peptide of negligible secondary structure (a random coil), we rationalize that \"temperature profiling\" by RP-HPLC can monitor association of peptide molecules, either through oligomerization or aggregation, or monitor unfolding of alpha-helical peptides with increasing temperature. We believe that the conformation-dependent response of peptides to RP-HPLC under changing temperature has implications both for general analysis and purification of peptides but also for the de novo design of peptides and proteins."}

We reviewed medical records of white adults with hemochromatosis and iron overload diagnosed during medical care. We defined three elements of compliance: 1) achieving iron depletion (serum ferritin </= 20 ng/ml); 2) timeliness of phlebotomies on a weekly or biweekly schedule to achieve iron depletion; and 3) participation in therapy to maintain serum ferritin </= 50 ng/ml. We evaluated associations of timeliness of phlebotomy and participation in maintenance therapy with these variables: age at diagnosis, sex, pretreatment serum ferritin concentration, HFE genotype, units of blood removed to achieve iron depletion, and presence or absence of cirrhosis at diagnosis. A total of 118 patients were evaluable for iron depletion and 142 for maintenance therapy; 96.6% achieved iron depletion, and 33.1% and 43.2% followed weekly and biweekly schedules, respectively. Timeliness was not significantly associated with the variables we evaluated. In the first year of maintenance therapy, 84.0% of patients complied; the percentage of C282Y homozygotes complying was significantly greater than that of other patients. Average compliance with maintenance therapy decreased 6.8% annually; the mean follow-up after achieving iron depletion was 4.1 +/- 2.8 yr (range 0.6-9.7 yr). Most patients with hemochromatosis diagnosed in medical care achieve iron depletion with phlebotomy; one-third tolerate and adhere to weekly phlebotomy. There is a constant rate of decline in the percentage of patients who comply with maintenance therapy."}

This test has improved early diagnosis, but cannot discriminate beryllium sensitization (BeS) from CBD. We previously found high neopterin levels in CBD patients' serum and questioned whether Be-stimulated neopterin production by peripheral blood cells in vitro might be useful in the diagnosis of CBD. CBD, BeS, Be exposed workers without disease (Be-exp) normal controls and sarcoidosis subjects were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMN) were cultured in the presence and absence of beryllium sulfate. Neopterin levels were determined from cell supernatants by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Clinical evaluation of CBD subjects included chest radiography, pulmonary function testing, exercise testing, and the BeLPT. CBD patients produced higher levels of neopterin in both unstimulated and Be-stimulated conditions compared to all other subjects (P < 0.0001). Unstimulated neopterin mononuclear cell levels overlapped among groups, however, Be-stimulated neopterin levels in CBD showed little overlap. Using a neopterin concentration of 2.5 ng/ml as a cutoff, Be-stimulated neopterin had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 100% for CBD and was able to differentiate CBD from BeS. Be-stimulated neopterin was inversely related to measures of pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and gas exchange. Neopterin may be a useful diagnostic adjunct in the non-invasive assessment of CBD, differentiating CBD from BeS. Further studies will be required to determine how it performs in workplace screening."}

In particular, they play an important role in the dynamics of the eukaryotic chromatin and are present in several chromatin-associated proteins. Recently, structures of several SET domains have been solved, and they contain a conserved fold that is unrelated to previously characterized methyltransferases, which possess either Rossmann fold or SPOUT domains. Phylogenetic and phyletic-profile analysis of the SET domain suggests that it was an evolutionary \"invention\" of the eukaryotic lineage, with secondary lateral transfers to bacteria. We show that the conserved N- and C- terminal regions, which comprise the core barrel-like module of the SET domain, are symmetric repeats of a simple 3-stranded unit. Furthermore, the two symmetrically arranged repeats contribute to the binding sites for the two substrates of the SET domain. This suggests the SET domain arose from an ancestral dimer of this 3-stranded unit, with each unit probably functioning as generic-ligand binding structure. The divergence between the two repeat units appears to have arisen as a result of their interactions with the central module of the SET domain, which was inserted between the two repeats. One of the repeats appears to have acquired adaptations, which helped it to specialize in AdoMet binding, whereas the second repeat contributed to histone-interaction, and in orienting a crucial active site residue. The central module of the SET domain supplies a critical asparagine to the active site, and its structural features suggest that it may have also arisen from a further duplication of one of the repeats comprising the core barrel. However, it appears to have structurally diverged from the two canonical repeats due to the lack of an obligate dimerization partner. The spatial position of the two repeats in the ancestral dimer appears to have favored the formation of the structural knot typical of the SET domain. A comparable knot is seen in the SPOUT-domain methyltransferases, and this represents a case of convergent evolution of an active-site-associated configuration in two otherwise unrelated classes of methylases. Thus, the SET domain provides a model for the innovation of a complex enzymatic fold through the duplications of a structurally simple non-enzymatic unit."}

Many of the mutations in the gene encoding AGT are associated with specific enzymatic phenotypes such as accelerated proteolysis (Ser205Pro), intra-peroxisomal aggregation (Gly41Arg), inhibition of pyridoxal phosphate binding and loss of catalytic activity (Gly82Glu), and peroxisome-to-mitochondrion mistargeting (Gly170Arg). Several mutations, including that responsible for AGT mistargeting, co-segregate and interact synergistically with a Pro11Leu polymorphism found at high frequency in the normal population. In order to gain further insights into the mechanistic link between genotype and enzymatic phenotype in PH1, we have determined the crystal structure of normal human AGT complexed to the competitive inhibitor amino-oxyacetic acid to 2.5A. Analysis of this structure allows the effects of these mutations and polymorphism to be rationalised in terms of AGT tertiary and quaternary conformation, and in particular it provides a possible explanation for the Pro11Leu-Gly170Arg synergism that leads to AGT mistargeting."}

Isomerization of the enol to keto forms was also observed using solid enol, a substance heretofore commonly believed to be the keto acid. Rates of ketonization were measured in perchloric acid, sodium hydroxide, and buffer solutions, and a ketonization rate profile was constructed. Rates of enolization of the keto acid were also measured using bromine to scavenge the enol as it formed. Rates of enolization and ketonization were then combined to provide the keto-enol equilibrium constant pK(E) = 1.27. This and some of the other results obtained are different from the corresponding quantities for the 2-oxocyclopentanecarboxylic acid keto-enol system. These differences are discussed."}

Those studies used 3' exon replacement (3'ER); a process in which the distal portion of RNA is reprogrammed. Here, we also show that the 5' end of mRNA can be completely rewritten by 5'ER. For proof-of-concept, and to test whether 5'ER could generate functional CFTR, we generated a mutant minigene target containing CFTR exons 10-24 (deltaF508) and a mini-intron 10, and a pretrans-splicing molecule (targeted to intron 10) containing CFTR exons 1-10 (+F508), and tested these two constructs in 293T cells for anion efflux transport. Cells cotransfected with target and PTM showed a consistent increase in anion efflux, but there was no response in control cells that received PTM or target alone. Using a LacZ reporter system to accurately quantify trans-splicing efficiency, we tested several unique PTM designs. These studies provided two important findings as follows: (1) efficient trans-splicing can be achieved by binding the PTM to different locations in the target, and (2) relatively few changes in PTM design can have a profound impact on trans-splicing activity. Tethering the PTM close to the target 3' splice site (as opposed to the donor site) and inserting an intron in the PTM coding resulted in a 65-fold enhancement of LacZ activity. These studies demonstrate that (1) SMaRT can be used to reprogram the 5' end of mRNA, and (2) efficiency can be improved substantially."}

A statewide, 2-stage, probability sample survey was conducted in 7 Tennessee general hospital EDs from June 1996 to January 1997. Main outcome measures were the prevalence of diagnosed substance abuse problems, positive bioassay results, denied use, and treatment need. Sensitivity and multivariate analyses were conducted by using varied case definitions of treatment need. Thirty-one percent (95% confidence interval [CI] 27.3% to 34.7%) of screened ED patients (n=1,330) had positive test results for substance use. Their prevalence of denial of use in the 30 days before the survey ranged from 10% for alcohol (95% CI 5.7% to 14.3%) to 100% for phencyclidine. One percent of all ED patients (n=1,502) had a recorded diagnosis of substance abuse. By contrast, as many as 27% (95% CI 23.3% to 31.8%) were assessed as needing substance abuse treatment on the basis of a comprehensive case definition that accounted for denial and positive test results. A sensitivity analysis using other case definitions is also presented. For example, 4% (95% CI 2.8% to 5.3%) of patients met the very strict definition of DSM-IV current drug dependence only. Under the comprehensive case definition, TennCare patients (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.63; 95% CI 1.30 to 2.05) and Medicare patients (adjusted OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.34 to 4.65) showed excess treatment need relative to the privately insured.

Both exams are noninvasive and include a visual component. Weighted data from the Adult Prevention Supplement of the 1998 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for adults 40 years of age or older were analyzed using SAS and SUDAAN. A ratio compared the percentage reporting an OCE (%OCE) with the percentage reporting a SCE (%SCE). The percentage having an OCE in the past year (13.8%) was very similar to the percentage having a SCE (13.5%) during that same period. With increasing age group, the %OCE/%SCE ratio varied inversely from 1.60 (C.I. 1.42-1.78) among persons 40-49 years to 0.62 (C.I. 0.55-0.69) among persons 70+ years. The ratio was similar in whites and blacks, males and females, and Hispanics and non-Hispanics. There was a positive gradient in the ratio by education and family income. Overall, less than 15% of the population is receiving either of these examinations, although the American Cancer Society recommends both of them on an annual basis for individuals 40 years of age and older. To increase detection of these cancers at early stages, extensive educational and media campaigns for the public and providers identifying risk factors and the availability of and the need for these examinations are required."}

{"pmid": "12881806", "title": "Overview of therapeutic vaccination approaches for cancer.", "abstract": "Recently, immunotherapy has been widely investigated for the treatment of cancer. While much of the success in this area lies with passive immunotherapy, the focus of this review is active vaccination strategies, which are showing promise. Cancer cells express a wide profile of different proteins, some of which are related to oncogenic transformation and are specific to cancer cells only. However, in cancer, most protein targets presented to the immune system from tumor cells are self-antigens. The immune system is highly tolerant of, and therefore does not react to, these self-antigens. Active immunotherapy aims to reverse this immune tolerance so the immune system can respond appropriately to self-antigens. To generate a successful antitumor response, several features should be considered: a target antigen on tumor cells to direct the immune response, a platform to present the vaccine-derived antigen to the immune system, an adjuvant to enhance immune stimulation, and appropriate monitoring techniques. New tools are becoming available for monitoring, although the clinical relevance for these assays needs to be established. Optimism for cancer vaccine approaches are increasing. Recent studies have shown that it is possible to break immune tolerance to self-antigens. Promising therapeutic clinical activity has been demonstrated, and other studies have shown that cancer vaccines are most beneficial for minimal residual disease states. Further optimization of cancer vaccines and larger clinical studies are required."}

No biological response to high doses of recombinant FSH was detected. A novel homozygous Pro(519)Thr mutation was found in this patient. This mutation is located in the second extracellular loop of the FSH receptor, within a motif highly conserved in gonadotropin and TSH receptors. The mutation totally impairs adenylate cyclase stimulation in vitro. FSH binding experiments and confocal microscopy showed that this mutation alters the cell surface targeting of the mutated receptor, which remains trapped intracellularly. Histological studies of the ovaries of the patient showed an increase in the density of small follicles compared with age-matched normal women. A complete block in follicular maturation after the primary stage was also observed. Immunocytochemical studies allowed detection of the expression of c-Kit and proliferation cellular nuclear antigen, whereas no apoptosis was shown by the 3'-end-labeling method. This observation supports the concept that in humans FSH seems mandatory for the initiation of follicular growth only after the primary stage. In our patient complete FSH resistance yields infertility, which is remarkably associated with the persistence of a high number of small follicles."}

Twenty-eight Wistar rats were divided into two groups: ethanol-fed (group E) and control (group C). Group E rats were given ethanol at a dose of 5 - 12 g x kg(-1) x d(-1), while group C received dextrose. Animals from both groups were killed at 4 and 8 weeks. The KCs were isolated and synthesis of TLR 4 protein was determined by laser scanning confocal microscopy. TLR 4 mRNA expression in KCs was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The levels of endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in plasma were determined. Changes in liver pathology were observed. Laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that the intensity of fluorescence of TLR 4 protein in group E was stronger than group C. Ethanol administration led to a significant increase in TLR 4 mRNA expression in group E compared with group C (P < 0.05). The concentrations of plasma endotoxin, TNF-alpha and IL-6 were higher in group E than in group C (P < 0.05). Liver sections from rats in group E demonstrated marked pathological changes. Ethanol administration can lead to the synthesis of TLR 4 protein and its gene expression in KCs, indicating that TLR 4 may play a major role in the development of alcohol-induced liver injury."}

The transcription of the prnB gene, encoding the proline transporter, is efficiently repressed only by the simultaneous presence of ammonium and glucose. Thus, repression of this gene demands the activation of the CreA repressor and the inactivation of the positive-acting GATA factor AreA. Repression of all other prn structural genes results largely from inducer exclusion. In an areA null mutation background, prnB is repressible by the sole presence of glucose. We have determined by EMSA and missing-base interference experiments that there are 15 AreA-binding sites in the prnD-prnB intergenic region. Only sites 13/14, in the proximity of the prnB TATA box, are clearly involved in transcriptional activation and regulation. Mutation of these sites mimics qualitatively the regulatory effect of an areA null mutation. The deletion of the TATA box has a measurable effect on the maximal level of prnB transcription but does not alter the regulation pattern of this gene."}

The effects of ATP, the stable ATP analogues alpha,beta-methylene ATP (alpha,beta-mATP), 2-methylthioATP (2meSATP) and adenosine tetraphosphate (ATP4), the pyrimidine nucleotide uridine 5'-triphosphate (UTP) and the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine were examined on the isolated perfused uterine vasculature of dioestrous, oestradiol-treated, dexamethasone-treated and late-pregnant guinea-pigs. 2. The alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine elicited concentration-dependent vasoconstriction from preparations of perfused uterine vasculature from dioestrous, estradiol-treated and late-pregnant guinea-pigs. The mean maximal response to phenylephrine was unaffected by treatment of dioestrus guinea-pigs with oestradiol or dexamethasone, but was reduced in preparations from late-pregnant animals. 3. In perfused uterine arteries from dioestrous animals, the pyrimidine UTP, but not ATP4 and ATP, elicited vasoconstrictor responses. In preparations from oestradiol-treated animals, all three agonists elicited vasoconstriction, with a rank order of potency of ATP4 = UTP >> ATP, whereas in preparations from late-pregnant animals this order of potency was ATP4 >> UTP = ATP. In preparations from dexamethasone-treated animals, the vasoconstriction was similar to that seen in dioestrous animals. Vasoconstrictor responses to ATP4 were significantly greater in preparations of uterine vasculature from oestradiol-treated and pregnant animals than in preparations from dioestrous animals or dexamethasone-treated animals. 4. In preparations from dioestrous, oestradiol-treated, pregnant and dexamethasone-treated animals, alpha,beta-mATP was approximately two to three orders of magnitude more potent than 2meSATP. Compared with preparations from dioestrous animals, the maximal responses to alpha,beta-mATP were significantly greater in tissues from oestradiol-treated and pregnant animals. In preparations from dioestrous animals, the P2 purinoceptor antagonist suramin (100 micro mol/L) inhibited the responses to alpha,beta-mATP, but not those to ATP4. 5. The present study has demonstrated that pregnancy, but not the steroid treatment of dioestrous guinea-pigs with oestradiol or dexamethasone, reduces the sensitivity of the guinea-pig isolated perfused uterine vasculature to phenylephrine. In contrast, preparations from pregnant or oestradiol-treated guinea-pigs respond to ATP4 and to alpha,beta-mATP with significantly greater constrictions than those of dioestrous or dexamethasone-treated animals. These data indicate that the sensitivity of the uterine vasculature to adrenoceptor and purinoceptor agonists is differentially regulated by oestradiol and pregnancy, but not by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone."}

Making several assumptions about the covariates, the present study uses survival analysis and other statistical techniques to analyse the 1996 South African population census data and examine the effects of selected independent variables on the timing of parenthood in the country. It was found that the onset of parenthood occurs late in South Africa compared with the pattern in most other African societies. While education plays a role in the postponement of parenthood within racial groups, it fails to explain the differences between African and Coloured women on the one hand, and White and Asian women on the other hand, a finding that suggests the existence of two regimes of family formation in South African society."}

The relationship between MMP-9 and its principal inhibitor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 (in voided urine samples) was also studied. A total of 134 patients with bladder tumors (7 cis, 76 T(a), 27 T(1), 24 T(2)-T(4); 40 G1, 43 G2, and 44 G3), 33 patients with benign urological conditions, and 36 healthy volunteers was studied. Samples from 106 patients with bladder cancer and 12 controls were stained for MMP-9. Clinical follow-up data were available on 116 patients (median: 25 months; range: 4-36 months). MMP-9 was present in all urine samples analyzed. There were no differences between patients with cancer and patients with benign disorders. However, patients had significantly higher urinary MMP-9 than normal volunteers (P = 0.0167). Urinary MMP-9 was associated with bladder tumors of advanced stage (P = 0.0065) and large size (P < 0.0001) but not with grade (P = 0.14), multiplicity (P = 0.31), recurrence (P = 0.55), progression (P = 0.83), or survival (P = 0.55). Low MMP-9:TIMP-1 ratios in patients with nonmuscle-invasive tumors were associated with higher recurrence rates (P = 0.0035). Sixty percent (64 of 106) of bladder tumor specimens expressed MMP-9 compared with none of 12 normal urothelial biopsies (P < 0.0001). MMP-9 staining was associated with tumor size (P = 0.014), disease progression (P = 0.005), and poor disease-specific survival (P = 0.022) but was unrelated to tumor stage (P = 0.46), grade (P = 0.26), multiplicity (P = 0.85), or recurrence rate (P = 0.62). High urinary MMP-9 levels are associated with large bladder tumors. A low urinary MMP-9:TIMP-1 ratio may indicate a higher risk of intraluminal nonmuscle-invasive tumor recurrence and may assist in planning follow-up surveillance protocols."}

Using post-embedding ultrastructural immunogold labelling, the distribution of glycinergic and GABAergic neurons and axonal terminals has been studied in the molecular, fusiform and polymorphic layers of the rat dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). This technique is not limited by the penetration of antibodies into the nervous tissue as in pre-embedding methods, and allows a fine neurochemical mapping of the nervous tissue. Numerous glycinergic and GABAergic axon terminals contain pleomorphic and flat synaptic vesicles, and are present in all layers (1, 2, 3) of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Glycine and GABA-negative large terminals (mossy fibres) are mainly seen in granule cell areas of layer 2 (fusiform layer). Mossy fibres contact the dendrites of GABA- and glycine-negative granule cells and of the few unipolar brush cells (excitatory neurons). The least common cells in the granule cell areas are GABAergic and glycinergic Golgi-stellate neurons. In unipolar brush cells, aggregations of vesicles seem to be the origin of their characteristic ringlet-bodies. Golgi-stellate cells send their inhibitory terminals to the dendrites of granule and unipolar brush cells, occasionally directly to mossy fibres. Small or (less frequently) large GABAergic terminals contact the soma or the main dendrite of unipolar brush cells. The circuit of a hypothetical functional unit of neurons in the DCN is proposed. The inputs from auditory tonotopic or non-auditory non-tonotopic mossy fibres eventually reach pyramidal cells through axons from the granule cells or unipolar brush cells. Pyramidal cells convey an excitatory signal from the DCN to higher mesencephalic nuclei for further elaboration of the acoustic signal."}

All subjects had normal eye examinations, refractive errors with spherical equivalents <5 diopters and astigmatism <2 diopters, normal intraocular pressures, no history of diseases affecting the visual field or nerve fiber layer, and normal white-white automated perimetry (Octopus 101, program G2). 21% of the subjects (6/28) had to be excluded since visual field testing was not reliable (reliability factor >5%). With the normal values provided by the manufacturer, only 45% of the remaining subjects (10/22) had all other indices within normal limits. With the appropriate normal values based on the multicenter SWAP Octopus 101 study, 11% (3/28) were beyond the normal range: all had abnormal high sensitivities - 2 due to false-positive response. The normal value range for the index Mean Defect is remarkably wide (5.-, median, 95.- percentile: -4.4, -0.5, +5.3 dB, respectively). The normal value range for the index Loss Variance is surprisingly low and similar to standard perimetry (5.-, median, 95.- percentile: -1.7, 6.8, +21.2 dB(2), respectively). SWAP with the Octopus G2 program reaches appropriate specificity but only if the correct normal values of the multicenter SWAP Octopus 101 study are used. The variability between subjects is remarkably large. The variability within a visual field is similar for SWAP and standard perimetry as reflected by similar values for the visual field index Loss Variance. Further studies have to establish the sensitivity to detect a disease for SWAP on the Octopus 101."}

It is however likely and well accepted that retrograde menstruation of endometrial cells into the pelvic cavity is the origin of this disease in many cases. Here we discuss a model in which retrogradely menstruated endometrial cells have different inherent developmental properties because they represent in fact a mixture of different developmental cell stages. These stages can be distinguished in part by the expression of marker proteins such as cytokeratin (intermediate filament protein of epithelial cells) or E-cadherin (intercellular adhesion protein of epithelial cells and metastasis suppressor molecule). Cytokeratin-positive E-cadherin negative cells, for example, would be less differentiated epithelial cells than cytokeratin-positive E-cadherin positive cells. In analogy to findings in other cell systems we assume that the cells which are undifferentiated or not fully differentiated still have the potential to give rise to differentiated daughter cells and, on the other hand, could be maintained as a pool of rather undifferentiated cells and capable of self renewal. This feature would be similar to stem cells (SC) and cells with plasticity. Interestingly we find epithelial cells of different developmental stages in deep infiltrating (e. g. of colon) or peritoneal endometriotic lesions. Therefore we conclude that less differentiated cells in retrogradely menstruated endometrial cell populations possibly representing SC features or plasticity might be the cellular source of primary endometriotic lesions and those present in lesions may contribute to the persistence of the disease by detaching and forming secondary lesions."}

An endoscopic scale was used to assess results on mucosa appearance. The mean course number was 2.3 (extremes 1-5). Bleeding score decreased from 2.67 to 0.77 (P<0.001). The success rate was 26/30 patients (87%) in an intention-to-treat analysis with 2 failures (6%), 1 patient lost for follow up and 1 patient not referred after one session. Improvement in endoscopic appearance was observed in the 13 endoscopically controlled patients with a decrease of the endoscopic score from 1.61 to 0.3 (P<0.002). The overall morbidity was 47% with 3 severe complications (10%): 1 severe bleeding, 1 extensive necrosis of lower part of the rectum and 1 perforation. We also noticed 3 microrecties and 2 symptomless rectal stenosis. With regard to tolerance, we observed post treatment pain in 6 patients (20%), easily released by usual antalgics. Complications and side effects occurred, in all patients but one, when power shot was > 45 W. Mean follow up was 20 months (3 to 35 months). Hematochezia recurred in 4 patients, but were easily treated with 1 APC course. APC is an effective treatment of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis, with a success rate of 87%.

FAST was used by third year surgical residents to detect intraperitoneal fluid and considered positive if such fluid was identified. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test. Of the 129 patients, there were 31 female (24%) and 98 male (76%) patients, with the mean age of 34 years. The mean Injury Severity Score was 13.2. 53 patients had proven intraabdominal injuries and 76 had no injuries. FAST was positive in 28 patients and negative in 101 patients. There were 3 false positive FAST. The sensitivity and specificity of FAST were 47.17 per cent and 96.05 per cent, respectively. The positive predictive value was 89.29 per cent, the negative predictive value was 72.28 per cent and the accuracy was 81.59 per cent.

PP UI was strongly associated with UI both before and during the present pregnancy, explaining 37.5% and 51.7% of postpartum UI, respectively. Eight percent experienced their first UI episode ever immediately after the delivery. Among women undergoing a cesarean section 8.8% reported postpartum UI, as contrasted with 24.9% in other women. Postpartum UI was positively associated with perineal suturing but un-associated with labor augmentation, episiotomy, birth weight, and breast-feeding. In the present study, which included a comprehensive causal model, postpartum UI could be explained first of all as the decline of pregnancy UI, secondly as a manifestation of a pre-existing tendency to react by UI, and finally as a consequence of the birth process itself."}

This study examined whether the mitochondrial pathway is associated with granulosa cell apoptosis during atresia in pig ovaries. Both mRNAs of caspase-9 and apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf1), which are major signal transducing components in the mitochondrial pathway, were detected in granulosa cells in healthy, early atretic and progressed atretic follicles by RT-PCR. No changes in the expression of Apaf1 mRNA were seen during follicular atresia, but the expression of caspase-9 mRNA increased during atresia. Apaf1 protein was steadily detected in granulosa cells prepared from healthy, early atretic and progressed atretic follicles by western blot analysis, but high expression of the precursor of caspase-9 (procaspase-9) was detected only in granulosa cells of healthy follicles. Decreased procaspase-9 protein was demonstrated during follicular atresia. Proteolytic activity of caspase-9 increased during atresia, in agreement with the diminution of procaspase-9 protein. Intensive expression of caspase-9 mRNA was demonstrated in the granulosa cells of early atretic and progressed atretic follicles but not in those of healthy follicles. These results indicate that the mitochondrial signalling pathway, which is mediated by Apaf1 and caspase-9, plays a crucial role in determining the fate of granulosa cells during atresia in pig ovaries."}

P0.1 and P0.1/P0.1 max and performed best in predicting extubation failure (areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves, 0.76 and 0.77 respectively). Assessment of P0.1 was the most useful airway pressure measurement in predicting extubation failure. Assessment of P0.1 may help to characterize children likely to fail extubation."}

A universal set of primers allowed sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej enterotoxin genes from S. aureus to be detected in a single real-time PCR assay with the LightCycler (LC) instrument. Using the universal forward primer and a type-specific reverse primer, real-time PCR assays allowed the S. aureus enterotoxin genes to be specifically genotyped. A collection of S. aureus isolates (n=83) was detected and further characterised for sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei, sej, using real-time PCR assays, and data were compared with those obtained by conventional block cycler PCR. Isolates were also tested for their ability to produce staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B, C and D by a commercial reversed passive latex agglutination (RPLA) test. Real-time PCR assays developed on the LightCycler system (LC-PCR) are a powerful tool for rapid detection and toxinotyping of the enterotoxin genes sea to sej from S. aureus. The work offers a very quick, reliable and specific alternative to conventional block cycler PCR assays to identify the enterotoxin profile of toxigenic S. aureus."}

To determine whether recurrent genomic imbalances are a feature of HL, CD30-positive HRS cells were laser-microdissected from 20 classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHLs) and four HL-derived cells lines and subjected to analyses by comparative genomic hybridization. In primary tumors, the most frequently involved chromosomal gains were 17q (70%), 2p (40%), 12q (40%), 17p (40%), 22q (35%), 9p (30%), 14q (30%), and 16p (30%), with minimal overlapping regions at 17q21, 2p23-13, 12q24, 17p13, 22q13, 9p24-23, 14q32, 16p13.3, and 16p11.2. The most frequent losses involved 13q (35%), 6q (30%), 11q (25%), and 4q (25%), with corresponding minimal overlapping regions at 13q21, 6q22, 11q22, and 4q32. Statistical analysis revealed significantly more gains of 2p and 14q in the older adult cases; loss of 13q was associated with a poor outcome. The results suggest that there is a set of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities associated with cHL and provide further evidence that cHL is genetically distinct from nodular lymphocyte predominance Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). Abnormalities of 17q are infrequent in other lymphomas or NLPHL; this finding, coupled with current knowledge of gene expression in cHL, suggests that genes present on 17q may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cHL."}

Deviations from this linearity could be accounted for on the basis of the developmental stage of the parasite. Erythrocyte-free P. lophurae showed activities which averaged 3 times that of uninfected erythrocytes, whereas infected erythrocytes had intermediate values. In addition, a patent infection was generally reflected by an increase in the lactic dehydrogenase activity in the plasma, but no direct correlation with parasitemia was established. Molecular heterogeneity of the enzyme was determined on the basis of kinetic data and electrophoretic isolation on a starch block. The uninfected red blood cell showed a major anodal and a minor cathodal peak of lactic dehydrogenase activity, and was further characterized by a kinetic constant representing a high pH optimum with low concentrations of substrate. Isolated P. lophurae had a single, cathodal peak of activity dissimilar from that of the uninfected erythrocyte, and a kinetic constant describing a low pH optimum with a high concentration of substrate. Infected erythrocytes showed a combination of these electrophoretic entities and an intermediate range of kinetic constants. The data indicate that the avian malaria parasite P. lophurae contains a lactic dehydrogenase qualitatively dissimilar from that of its host cell, and the increased enzymatic activity of infected erythrocytes is a result of the enzyme content of the growing parasite added to that of the red blood cell. It is suggested that the LDH of the parasite has a physiological advantage under those conditions which prevail inside the red blood cell."}

The reactions show first-order rate dependency on both substrate and metal ion complex and a pH dependence which is diagnostic of the acid dissociation of the reactive species. The mechanism of the metal catalyzed transesterification of HPNP has been assessed by solvent isotopic kinetic effect studies and involves the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the substrate alcoholic group, activated by metal ion coordination. The intrinsic reactivity of the different complexes is controlled by the nature and structure of the ligand: complexes of tridentate ligands, particularly if characterized by a facial coordination mode, are more reactive than those of tetradentate ligands which can hardly allow binding sites for the substrate. In the case of tridentate ligands that form complexes with a facial coordination mode, a linear Brønsted correlation between the reaction rate (log k) and the pK(a) of the active nucleophile is obtained. The beta(nuc) values are 0.75 for the HPNP transesterification and 0.20 for the BNP hydrolysis. These values are indicated as the result of the combination of two opposite Lewis acid effects of the Zn(II) ion: the activation of the substrate and the efficiency of the metal coordinated nucleophile. The latter factor apparently prevails in determining the intrinsic reactivity of the Zn(II) complexes."}

Cross-sectional study of all residents with advanced cognitive impairment who had Minimum Data Set assessments within 60 days of April 1, 1999, (N = 186,835) and who resided in Medicare- or Medicaid-certified US nursing homes. Main Outcomes Measures Facility and resident characteristics described in the 1999 On-line Survey Certification of Automated Records and the 1999 Minimum Data Set. Multivariate analysis using generalized estimating equations determined the facility and resident factors independently associated with feeding tube use. Thirty-four percent of residents with advanced cognitive impairment had feeding tubes (N = 63,101). Resident characteristics associated with a greater likelihood of feeding tube use included younger age, nonwhite race, male sex, divorced marital status, lack of advance directives, a recent decline in functional status, and no diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Controlling for these patient factors, residents living in facilities that were for profit (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.12); located in an urban area (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11-1.16); having more than 100 beds (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07); and lacking a special dementia care unit (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.15) had a higher likelihood of having a feeding tube. Additionally, feeding tube use was more likely among residents living in facilities that had a smaller proportion of residents with do-not-resuscitate orders, had a higher prevalence of nonwhite residents, and lacked a nurse practitioner or physician assistant on staff. More than one third of severely cognitively impaired residents in US nursing homes have feeding tubes.

One-fifth of these cases of FALS are associated with mutations in copper/zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD1), but the gene defect in the remaining 80% of familial cases is, as yet, unknown. We have carried out a preliminary genome screen, using a U.K. resource of families lacking SOD1 mutations, to identify other potential disease loci and have identified a putative locus on chromosome 16q12.1-q12.2. The region associated with disease was further refined in the major family that contributed to this result and was localized to D16S409-D16S3032, a 14.74-cM genetic interval that corresponds to a physical distance of 6.6 Mb, which coincides with a region independently identified by two further research groups in the United States and the United Kingdom."}

The effect of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1)-beta on CGRP release from these sensory neurons was investigated. The results showed that IL-1beta (1 ng/ml) could directly induce CGRP release following prolonged incubation (24 hr) with these neurons. Treatment with IL-1beta (0.1-1.0 ng/ml) significantly increased CGRP release in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment of DRG cells with actinomycin D at 1 microM or cyclohexamide at 10 microM for 30 min inhibited 1 ng/ml IL-1beta-induced CGRP release in DRG neurons of neonatal rats. The inhibitors of PKC, JNK MAPK and NF-kappaB, but not p38 or ERK1/2 MAPK, blocked IL-1beta-induced CGRP release. RNase protection assay showed that IL-1beta could cause alpha-CGRP mRNA increase in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, although the level of beta-CGRP mRNA was not affected. These results indicate that IL-1beta may activate PKC, which in turn initiates JNK MAPK and activates NF-kappaB and finally induces alpha-CGRP gene expression and release from these sensory neurons."}

Randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study. Seventy-six investigative sites in the United States. Seven hundred twenty-three patients > or =40 years of age with COPD and a mean baseline FEV(1) of 42% predicted. FP (250 microg), SM (50 microg), FP plus SM combined in a single inhaler (FSC), or placebo administered twice daily through the Diskus device for 24 weeks. Primary efficacy measures were morning predose (ie, trough FEV(1)) for FSC compared with SM and 2-h postdose FEV(1) for FSC compared with FP. Other efficacy measures were as follows: morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEF); transition dyspnea index; chronic respiratory disease questionnaire; chronic bronchitis symptom questionnaire; exacerbations; and other symptomatic measures. At Endpoint (ie, the last on-treatment, post-baseline assessment), treatment with FSC significantly (p < or = 0.012) increased the morning predose FEV(1) (165 mL) compared with SM (91 mL) and placebo (1 mL), and significantly (p < or = 0.001) increased the 2-h postdose FEV(1) (281 mL) compared with FP (147 mL) and placebo (58 mL). Improvements in lung function with FSC compared with FP and SM, and with FP and SM compared with placebo, as measured by the average daily morning PEF, was observed within approximately 24 h after the initiation of treatment, indicating an early onset of effect (p < or = 0.034). Compared with placebo, FSC significantly improved dyspnea, quality of life, and symptoms of chronic bronchitis. The incidence of adverse effects (except for an increase in oral candidiasis with FSC and FP) were similar among the treatment groups. Treatment with FSC (FP, 250 microg, and SM, 50 microg) twice daily substantially improved morning lung function and sustained these improvements for over a period of 24 weeks compared with FP or SM treatment alone in patients with COPD, with no additional safety concerns for the combination treatment vs that with the individual components."}

The physiopathology of cardiac failure in man as well as at animal is again badly elucidated. The aim of our study has consisted in evaluating the hemodynamic variations of the Rat poisoned by the venom of the Buthus occitanus scorpion and to contribute through the analyse of plasmatic concentrations of catecholamines and by an histomorphometric study of muscular microcirculation to explain the mechanism of the hemodynamic perturbations and cardiac failure. 51 rats corresponding to 9 groups (witness and poisoned) have been used. The venom of the scorpion Buthus occitanus has been administrated at 850 micrograms/kg. Two groups have been served for hemodynamic study, three groups for the dosage of catecholamines and four groups for histomorphometric study. It has been observed a biphasic variation of arterial pressure and cardiac frequency after venom injection. Four minutes after envenimation, the plasmatic level of catecholamines was strongly higher in the poisoned according to the witness one. Histomorphometric study of muscular skeletal microcirculation has shown a decrease of relative vascular volume contemporary with the increase of plasmatic catecholamines concentration and the peak of arteriel pressure appeared just after envenimation. 10 and 20 minutes after envenimation, the relative vascular volume has significantly increased as well as that interstitium according to witness lot. These hemodynamic perturbations can be attributed to the important dump in catecholamines. This hyperadrenergy was contemporary with decrease of relative muscular vascular volume. This decrease would be explained by a constriction of vessels. On the other hand, the second increase of the vascular relative volume suggests the possibility of development of venous stasis at the muscular microcirculation. It would be induced by a cardiac failure and/or the effect of vasoplegic mediators being able to entail an interstitial oedema in the muscular skeletal that would led to increase the relative interstitial volume observed in this study."}

Treatment of cells with HNE led to a decrease in the level of Akt activity due to the dephosphorylation at Ser473, a major regulatory phosphorylation site. HNE-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt was prevented by a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor, okadaic acid, and by a caspase-3 inhibitor, DEVD-CHO. HNE treatment resulted in an increase in the total level of PP2A activity, release of active tyrosine-dephosphorylated PP2A from the cytoskeleton and PP2A-Akt association, which were all dependent on caspase-3 activation. These results suggest that the level of PP2A activity is at least in part determined by its tyrosine phosphorylation, which is dually controlled by okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatases and protein-tyrosine kinases. Possibly underlying the mechanism of caspase-mediated activation of PP2A, HNE treatment resulted in downregulation of the activity of Src kinase, as a representative caspase-sensitive kinase to phosphorylate PP2A at tyrosine. In addition, activated caspase-3 partially cleaved Akt at a late stage of the apoptosis. These results indicate the existence of two distinct caspase-dependent signal pathways for downregulation of Akt that works as a mechanism of positive feedback regulation for HNE-triggered apoptotic signals."}

I present an application of the \"biometric method\" for estimating mutational parameters for male fitness characters of the yellow monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus. The biometric method rests on two critical assumptions. The first is that experimental inbreeding changes genotype frequencies without changing allele frequencies; i.e., there is no genetic purging during the experiment. I satisfy this condition by employing a breeding design in which the parents are randomly extracted, fully homozygous inbred lines. The second is that all genetic variation is attributable to deleterious mutations maintained in mutation-selection balance. I explicitly test this hypothesis using likelihood ratios. Of the three deleterious mutation models tested, the first two are rejected for all characters. The failure of these models is due to an excess of additive genetic variation relative to the expectation under mutation-selection balance. The third model is not rejected for either of two log-transformed male fitness traits. However, this model imposes only \"weak conditions\" and is not sufficiently detailed to provide estimates for mutational parameters. The implication is that, if biometric methods are going to yield useful parameter estimates, they will need to consider mutational models more complicated than those typically employed in experimental studies."}

In addition, a comparison was made with doses of detomidine and xylazine that produce equivalent degrees of sedation. Randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded cross-over study. Six adult Swiss warmblood horses, one mare and five geldings, weighing from 530 to 650 kg and aged 6-15 years. Nociceptive thresholds were measured using an electrical stimulus applied to the coronary band and using a pneumatically operated pin pressing on the cannon bone. Measurements were made immediately before and every 15 minutes for 2 hours after IV injection of the test substances. Lifting of the foot indicated the test end point. The three alpha2-agonists caused a temporary increase in nociceptive thresholds with a maximal effect within 15 minutes and a return to baseline levels within 1 hour. Using electrical current testing nociceptive thresholds were significantly different from placebo (mean +/- SD) for detomidine at 15 minutes (from control 5.8 +/- 0.9 to 23.3 +/- 3.9 mA, p = 0.0066) and 30 minutes (from control 6.6 +/- 1.1 to 18.8 +/- 3.3 mA, p = 0.0091). The difference was significant for romifidine at 15 minutes only (from control 5.8 +/- 0.9 to 18.7 +/- 3.8 mA, p = 0.0066). With mechanical pressure testing nociceptive thresholds were significantly different from control for detomidine at 15 minutes (from 3.2 +/- 0.2 to 6.2 +/- 0.5 N, p = 0.00076) and 30 minutes (from 3.2 +/- 0.7 to 5.7 +/- 0.8 N, p = 0.0167).

At 15 minutes the order of magnitude of the measured antinociceptive effect was significantly different between the two pain tests for both romifidine and detomidine, but not for xylazine. For romifidine, the increase of mean thresholds compared to placebo was 4.0 +/- 1.3 times placebo levels with the electrical current test compared to 1.3 +/- 0.3 times for the mechanical pressure test (p = 0.037). For detomidine, the increase of mean thresholds compared to placebo was 5.4 +/- 1.7 times control levels with the electrical current test compared to 2.0 +/- 0.2 times for the mechanical pressure test (p = 0.040). This represents a 2.7 (romifidine) and 3.4 times (detomidine) greater increase in thresholds using electrical current testing compared to the use of mechanical pressure testing. This study demonstrates the analgesic potential of alpha2-agonists in the horse for somatic pain and that they can have quantitatively different antinociceptive effects according to the antinociceptive test used."}

For reusable biopsy forceps, the evaluation of costs included purchase prices, cleaning (chemicals, equipment, technician time), and a fee for sterilization in a centralized facility. The cost evaluation for disposable biopsy forceps included acquisition and destruction costs. Costs were expressed in United States dollars.

During the last century, scientific studies have demonstrated that cornstarch produces tissue injury in literally every part of the body. Because this glove lubricant cannot be removed from the glove, Dr. David Podell, an ophthalmologic surgeon, and his cousin, Howard Podell, a chemical engineer, devised the first powder-free surgical glove that could be donned easily. They coated the inner surface of the surgical glove with a methacrylate polymer lining that was bonded to the natural rubber latex. This special coating acts as a lubricant to facilitate donning with damp, wet, or dry hands. In our earlier experimental studies, we confirmed that these polymer-lined latex gloves could be donned with either wet or dry hands. More recently, the polymer-coated latex gloves were incorporated into a double-glove hole puncture indication system that accurately detected glove holes in the presence of fluid. Because this discovery has been expanded into the development of a non-latex double-glove hole puncture indication system, we have expanded our biomechanical performance studies to examine the glove donning forces of the latex and non-latex glove hole puncture indication systems. The maximum donning forces recorded for the non-latex undergloves were significantly lower than those encountered by the same respective sizes of the latex underglove. The donning forces of the thin Biogel Super-Sensitive outer gloves were remarkably similar to the donning forces of the Biogel Indicator undergloves. The thicker Biogel outer gloves encountered greater donning forces than that noted for the Biogel Super-Sensitive outer gloves. The donning forces recorded for the non-latex outer gloves were remarkably similar to those noted for the latex Biogel outer gloves. Because the results of this biomechanical performance study demonstrated that the latex and non-latex double-glove hole puncture indication systems can be easily donned by surgeons using relatively low donning forces, this study provides convincing evidence that these double-glove hole puncture indication systems can be used in all surgical procedures."}

This article addresses how much is enough and how to make defensible decisions in HIPAA implementation for smaller healthcare organizations."}

Above all, they ensure long-term improvement in quality of life and patients' satisfaction. A specific study on the outcomes of endoscopic sinus surgery is presented. A longitudinal observational study of 51 patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery for recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis was done in two hospitals. Patients were evaluated preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively with a disease-specific health status questionnaire (Quebec French-Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measure) and a general health status questionnaire (the Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey). The results show statistically significant improvement in quality of life after endoscopic sinus surgery in both the disease-specific and the disease-generic health status questionnaires. The broader subject of objective and subjective outcomes assessment, along with evidence-based evaluation, is discussed."}

Survey research using a self-report questionnaire. Field survey on convenience sample in California and in Seoul, Korea. 225 KA and 216 Korean mothers. Frequency of eating at home, preparation of Korean foods, favorite dishes of families, and for special occasions. Chi-square, t test, and analysis of variance. Families of the more acculturated mothers dined out more frequently and had lower preferences for Korean foods than did the families with less acculturated mothers. The more acculturated mothers prepared Korean foods, including kimchi, less at home. Fewer Korean dishes were included among the 5 favored dishes, both for family and for special occasions, in KA families than in Korean families. The acculturation stage of the mothers affected preference for Korean dishes of the families but not for special occasions. Mothers' acculturation stage influenced the family's eating habits. Changes of preference of typical Korean dishes varied by acculturation stage. Nutrition educators should be aware that dietary behaviors of KA families may differ by acculturation stage and tailor interventions appropriately."}

We evaluated the anticoagulant activity of exogenous TFPI added either to the plasma of patients with venous thrombosis (n = 118) or to the plasma of healthy controls similar in terms of mean age and sex ratio (n = 107). A poor anticoagulant response to TFPI, defined as TFPI resistance, was observed in 4.7% of controls and in 11.0% of patients. TFPI resistance was associated with an almost threefold increase in the risk of thrombosis and could therefore represent a novel hemostatic risk factor for venous thrombosis."}

PCC 7942, SmtB, functioning as the sensor to heavy-metal ions (notably Zn-ion) in the dimer form, represses the transcription of smtA gene encoding metallothionein-like protein. There are two recognition DNA sequences in the operator/promoter region of smtA gene, and the binding of SmtB with Zn-ions reduces the affinities to these sequences. This induces the activation of smtA transcription. In this study, we have studied the functional differences between these two recognition DNA sequences, with spectroscopic (hetero-nuclear NMR and UV-resonance Raman) and biochemical methods. On the basis of the results obtained here, we clarified the regulation mechanism of the smtA expression. Similar regulatory system for the tolerance to Zn-ion stress is found in another cyanobacterium. We also found that the functionally important differences between these two systems are mainly due to the structural differences of recognition DNA sequences."}

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) by their action on adipocytes have been independently linked to the pathogenesis of insulino-resistance. In isolated adipocytes, TNFalpha induces the expression of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The purpose of the present work was, in the 3T3-F442A adipocyte cell line, to characterise TNFalpha-induced iNOS expression and to determine whether or not ET-1 could influence TNFalpha-induced iNOS expression and NO production. 2. In differentiated 3T3-F442A, treatment with TNFalpha (20 ng ml(-1)) induced the expression of a functional iNOS as demonstrated by nitrite assay, Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis. TNFalpha-induced iNOS expression requires nuclear factor kappaB activation, but does not necessitate the activation of the PI-3 kinase/Akt and P38-MAP kinase pathways. 3. ET-1, but not ET-3, inhibited the TNFalpha-induced expression of iNOS protein and mRNA as well as nitrite production. The effects of ET-1 were blocked by a specific ETA (BQ123, pA(2) 7.4) but not by a specific ETB receptor antagonist (BQ788). 3T3-F442A adipocytes express the mRNAs for prepro-ET-1 and the ET-A receptor subtype, but not for the ET-B subtype. 4. The inhibitory effect of ET-1 was not affected by bisindolylmaleimide, SB 203580 or indomethacin, inhibitors of protein kinase C, p38-MAP kinase and cyclooxygenase, respectively, and was not associated with cAMP production. However, the effect of ET-1 was partially reversed by wortmannin, suggesting the involvement of PI3 kinase in the transduction signal of ET-1. 5. Differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes did not release ET-1 with or without exposure to TNFalpha, although the mRNA for preproET-1 was detected in both pre- and differentiated adipocytes. 6. Thus, these results confirm that adipocytes are a target for circulating ET-1 and demonstrate that the activation of the ETA receptor subtype can prevent TNFalpha-induced iNOS expression."}
{"pmid": "12904168", "title": "The role of apoptosis-inducing receptors of the tumor necrosis factor family in thyroid cancer.", "abstract": "The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family comprises several ligands, such as the prototype TNF-alpha, the Fas ligand (FasL) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L), which trigger apoptosis in susceptible cells by activating respective cell-surface receptors. The study of these cell death pathways has attracted significant attention in several fields, including that of thyroid cancer, because they participate in immune system function, as an arm of cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and because recombinant ligands are available for pharmacological use. TNF-alpha is a pluripotent cytokine that induces both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic effects on thyroid carcinoma cells. FasL triggers apoptosis in other tumor types, but thyroid carcinoma cells are resistant to this effect. On the other hand, TRAIL potently and selectively kills thyroid carcinoma cells. Consequently, TRAIL is the only member of the family with significant anticancer activity and an acceptable toxicity profile to be used as a novel therapy for thyroid cancer. The caspase inhibitor FLIP plays a significant role in negatively regulating receptor-induced apoptosis. Thelper 1-type cytokines, such as interferon-gamma, TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta increase the sensitivity of both normal and neoplastic thyrocytes to FasL and TRAIL. On the other hand, IGF-I and other growth/survival factors produced in the local tumor microenvironment activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt kinase pathway and exert an anti-apoptotic effect by upregulating several apoptosis inhibitors, including FLIP. Pharmacological modulation of apoptosis induced by FasL and TRAIL/Apo2L holds promise of therapeutic applications in human malignancies."}

It is presumed to play a central regulatory role in the Rhizobium-legume interaction, being expressed well before the initiation of cortical cell divisions resulting in nodule formation. Two small peptides encoded by enod40 mRNA as well as its secondary structure have been shown to be key elements in the signalling processes underlying nodule organogenesis. Here results concerning the secondary structure of mRNA of enod40 in soybean are presented. This study combined a theoretical approach, involving structure prediction and comparison, as well as structure probing. Our study indicates five conserved domains in enod40 mRNA among numerous leguminous species. Structure comparison suggests that some domains are also conserved in non-leguminous species and that an additional domain exists that was found only in leguminous species developing indeterminate nodules. Enzymatic and chemical probing data support the structure for three of the domains, and partially for the remaining two. The rest of the molecule appears to be less structured. Some of the domains include motifs, such as U-containing internal loops and bulges, which seem to be conserved. Therefore, they might be involved in the regulatory role of enod40 RNA."}

Although HTLV-I is known to be associated with infective dermatitis in childhood, other HTLV-I-associated morbidity in children has not been well studied. We sought to determine the HTLV-I-associated health effects in Jamaican children. We compared incidence rates of several health outcomes in 28 HTLV-I-infected and 280 uninfected children clinically followed from age 6 weeks to a maximum of 10 years. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to analyze these prospectively collected data, adjusting for confounding effects of other variables as necessary. HTLV-I-infected children had significantly higher incidence rates of seborrheic dermatitis (rate ratio [RR] = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.9-12.5), eczema (RR = 3.1, CI = 1.2-7.9) and persistent hyperreflexia (RR = 3.7, CI = 1.6-8.2). Additionally, HTLV-I infected children had increased rates of severe anemia (RR = 2.5, CI = 0.8-7.9) and abnormal lymphocytes (RR = 2.4, CI = 0.8-7.6) that were of borderline statistical significance. Our study suggests that HTLV-I-associated skin diseases of childhood may include seborrheic dermatitis and eczema. Additionally, these data suggest that persistent hyperreflexia of the lower limbs may be an early sign of HTLV-I-associated neurologic involvement in children. Expansion and continued clinical observation of this cohort would be valuable."}

Most clinicians use intravenous immunoglobulin or prednisone as first-line therapy. Unfortunately, the clinical trials performed to date are not easily extrapolated to answer, \"which agent is best for clinical practice\" because they have used varying doses and duration of therapy, different diagnostic criteria for CIDP, and mixtures of patients who have failed previous therapy versus those with newly diagnosed disease. There are a number of small case series describing the efficacy of immune-modulating agents, such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, interferon-alpha, and mycophenolate mofetil. These studies generally use these medications as second-line agents for patients who failed corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin.

A randomized controlled trial assessed youth and parents at baseline and at 1, 3 and 6-month posttreatment points. Youth participants (N=43) met diagnostic criteria for one or more psychoactive substance use disorders with most youth meeting criteria for alcohol and marijuana use disorders. IFCBT produced significant reductions in posttreatment substance use when compared against DHPE. Throughout the 6-month posttreatment period, youth receiving IFCBT used alcohol an average of 2.03 days each month, which was significantly lower than the average number of 6.06 days that DHPE youth used alcohol during the same period. Similarly, youth receiving IFCBT used marijuana an average of 5.67 days each month during the initial 6 posttreatment months which was also significantly lower than the average number of 13.83 days that DHPE youth used marijuana each month during the same period. IFCBT also reduced rates of any marijuana use and produced significant changes in targeted psychosocial risk and protective factors. IFCBT youth exhibited significantly higher levels of rational problem solving and learning strategy skills, and significantly lower levels of problem avoidance when compared with DHPE youths. IFCBT parents exhibited significantly more adaptive scores on communication, involvement, control, and values/norms indices when compared with DHPE parents. No iatrogenic effects were exhibited among youth in either IFCBT or DHPE conditions on the outcome measures examined. The present study findings suggest that IFCBT is a promising approach for the treatment of adolescents with psychoactive substance use disorders."}

Therefore, the search for new markers, especially among cell cycle-regulatory molecules, is a high priority, both in terms of prognostication and for identification of novel targets. p21 regulates the outcome of the p53 response to DNA damage, as might occur after administration of a chemotherapeutic agent, and we have shown that attenuation of p21 using an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) inhibits cell proliferation in vitro and decreases growth of Met-1 mammary carcinomas in mice. In the current study, we extend this work to human cells and tissue. Three of eight human breast tumors that we obtained from a tissue bank show markedly increased p21 levels, variably staining in the nucleus and cytosol. All corresponding normal tissues were p21 negative. In the three p21-positive tumors, the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase-relevant signaling proteins p85 and PTEN were also increased. To investigate whether p21 is a feasible target for attenuation in human breast cancer, we investigated two human carcinoma cell lines. When transfected with antisense p21 ODN, both MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells exhibit dose-dependent attenuation of p21 levels, associated with apoptosis in the absence of an additional apoptotic stimulus. Because p21 regulates the cellular repair response to damaged DNA, our work suggests that attenuation of p21 using our antisense p21 ODN may be effective in modulating the progression of breast cancer in either the presence or absence of combination chemotherapy and sets the stage for future clinical trials."}

The drug is believed to be associated with fewer adverse effects than conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the effectiveness of celecoxib in the treatment of acute pain has not yet been assessed by systematic review. To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of a single oral dose of celecoxib for moderate to severe postoperative pain. We searched the Cochrane Library Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, Biological Abstracts, PubMed and the Oxford Pain database. Date of the most recent search: May 2002. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults prescribed any dose of oral celecoxib or placebo for acute postoperative pain were included. Two trials (418 subjects) met the inclusion criteria for this review. The trials were assessed for quality and the data extracted by two independent reviewers. Summed pain relief (TOTPAR) or pain intensity difference (SPID) was extracted and converted into dichotomous information yielding the number of patients with at least 50% pain relief over 4-6 hours. These derived results were used to calculate the relative benefit (RB) and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) for one patient to achieve at least 50% pain relief. The number-needed-to-treat for celecoxib 200 mg compared with placebo was 4.5 (CI 3.3 to 7.2). For every 4.5 patients experiencing moderate to severe acute pain treated with celecoxib 200 mg one more will experience at least 50% pain relief that would not have done had they received placebo. The median time to remedication over 24 hours was 5.1 hours with celecoxib 200 mg and 1.5 hours with placebo. Quantitative analysis of adverse effects was not possible but no serious or unexpected adverse effects were reported. Single dose oral celecoxib is an effective means of postoperative pain relief, similar in efficacy to aspirin 600/650 mg, and paracetamol 1000 mg. The two trials included used celecoxib 200 mg, a dose 50% less than is recommended for acute pain. More trials are needed to estimate efficacy for recommended dose of 400 mg, and to reinforce current findings for 200 mg, and provide data for pooled quantitative estimates of adverse effects."}

This recognition was abolished by immunoadsorption with two of the three selected peptides. The anti-peptide antibodies fixed onto Protein A-Sepharose specifically immunoprecipitated a S. mansoni AWSE component that was able to degrade bovine hemoglobin at pH 3.8. This reaction was inhibited by 7 microM pepstatin A, a classical aspartyl protease inhibitor, suggesting that the parasite cathepsin D was immunoprecipitated. The anti-peptide antibodies also recognized on a dot-blot assay a purified, commercially obtained bovine cathepsin D preparation but not the purified human counterpart. On the other hand, the anti-bovine cathepsin D serum recognized the two above-mentioned schistosome peptides. In addition, S. mansoni-infected patient sera recognized on immunoblots the bovine but not the human cathepsin D. These results, together with a comparative analysis of the selected peptide sequence regions between the schistosome and the two mammal enzymes, allowed us to pinpoint to one amino acid the cross-reactivity between parasite and bovine cathepsin D and the lack of it with human cathepsin D.

Twenty-one patients (8 women and 13 men) aged 29 to 65 years (mean, 51 years) who had a clinical presentation and examination consistent with chronic neuropathic pain (for at least 6 months) with hyperalgesia (n = 21) and allodynia (n = 7). Patients were randomized to two 7-day treatment orders in a crossover design. Two daily doses of CT-3 (four 10-mg capsules per day) or identical placebo capsules were given during the first 4 days and 8 capsules per day were given in 2 daily doses in the following 3 days. After a washout and baseline period of 1 week each, patients crossed over to the second 7-day treatment period. Visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale scores for pain; vital sign, hematologic and blood chemistry, and electrocardiogram measurements; scores on the Trail-Making Test and the Addiction Research Center Inventory-Marijuana scale; and adverse effects. The mean differences over time for the VAS values in the CT-3-placebo sequence measured 3 hours after intake of study drug differed significantly from those in the placebo-CT-3 sequence (mean [SD], -11.54 [14.16] vs 9.86 [21.43]; P =.02). Eight hours after intake of the drug, the pain scale differences between groups were less marked. No dose response was observed. Adverse effects, mainly transient dry mouth and tiredness, were reported significantly more often during CT-3 treatment (mean [SD] difference, -0.67 [0.50] for CT-3-placebo sequence vs 0.10 [0.74] for placebo-CT-3 sequence; P =.02). There were no significant differences with respect to vital signs, blood tests, electrocardiogram, Trail-Making Test, and Addiction Research Center Inventory-Marijuana scale. No carryover or period effects were observed except on the Trail-Making Test. In this preliminary study, CT-3 was effective in reducing chronic neuropathic pain compared with placebo. No major adverse effects were observed."}

Crossbred multiparous sows were inseminated once either at 15-20 h after ovulation [experiment 1, slaughtered at 20-25 h (5-6 h after artificial insemination (AI), group 1-A, n = 4), at 70 h after ovulation (group 1-B, n = 4), on day 11 (group 1-C, n = 4, first day of standing oestrus = day 1) or on day 19 (group 1-D, n = 4)] or 30 h after ovulation [experiment 2, slaughtered at 5-6 h after AI (group 2-A, n = 4) or on day 19 (group 2-D, n = 3)]. The uterine horns were flushed to control for the presence of spermatozoa and neutrophils and/or for recovery of oocytes and/or embryos. Mesometrial uterine samples were plastic embedded and stained. Cryofixed uterine samples were analysed by immunohistochemistry using mAbs to lymphocyte subpopulations and MHC class II molecules. Light microscopy was used to examine surface (SE) and glandular epithelia (GE), and connective tissue layers, both subepithelially (SL) and glandular (GL). In experiment 1, group 1-A, only one sow had spermatozoa in the utero-tubal junction (UTJ). Marked/moderated numbers of neutrophils and spermatozoa were observed in the flushings of two sows. In group 1-B, altogether 23 of 48 oocytes were cleaved. Day 11 (1-C), embryos with small diameter were observed. Day 19 (1-D), no embryos were found but small pieces of foetal membrane were observed in one of the sows. In group 1-A, large numbers of neutrophils were found within the SE and SL but with high individual variation. For T lymphocyte subpopulations, in the SE, most CD2+ cells were found in group 1-A. For both SE and GE in all groups, the number of CD8+ cells was significantly larger than that of CD4+ cells. In experiment 2, group 2-A, no sow had spermatozoa in the UTJ or in the uterine flushings. At day 19, no sow was pregnant. In group 2-A, large numbers of neutrophils were found within the SE and SL but with high individual variation. At day 19, high E2 levels showed a hormonal prooestrous stage but the endometrial neutrophil infiltration normally expected at pro-oestrus was absent. In conclusion, post-ovulatory insemination (about 18 h after ovulation) resulted in impaired spermatozoa transport within the uterus and embryonic degeneration. In sows post-ovulatory inseminated at a later stage (30 h after ovulation), no sow was pregnant. In both experiments, disturbed immune cell patterns were observed in some individuals."}

Because cholecystokinin and its receptors (A and B) have a functional interaction with dopaminergic neurotransmission, alterations in them may constitute a predisposition for Parkinson's disease. We performed a case-control study to investigate the association between the cholecystokinin system and Parkinson's disease using genetic markers for three genes: cholecystokinin and its two receptors (A and B). One hundred and sixty patients with Parkinson's disease and 160 controls, matched for age, gender, ethnic origin and area of residence, were recruited. Cholecystokinin -45C>T, cholecystokinin-A receptor 779T>C and cholecystokinin-B receptor 1550G>A gene polymorphisms were studied using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. These three gene polymorphisms showed no correlation with risk of Parkinson's disease; however, the cholecystokinin CT/TT genotype was associated with a 4.429-fold increased risk for visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease. Cholecystokinin-A receptor and B receptor polymorphisms, considered alone, showed no correlation with hallucinations in Parkinson's disease; however, a combined effect was found in patients with hallucinations harboring both the cholecystokinin CT/TT and cholecystokinin-A receptor TC/CC genotypes. Parkinson's disease patients harboring this genotype have a 5.922-fold increased risk for developing visual hallucinations. These results suggest that, in Chinese, visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease are associated with cholecystokinin -45C>T polymorphism, and this association was still observed in the presence of the cholecystokinin-A receptor TC/CC genotype, indicating a possible interaction of these two genes in the visual hallucinogenesis in Parkinson's disease."}

A large number of villages was surveyed, and 4,112 persons were examined, of whom 863 were found to be positive for microfilariae in the peripheral blood and 215 to have filarial disease. The chief manifestation was elephantiasis of the leg, which was sometimes associated with elephantiasis of the arm. The causative organism of endemic filariasis in Thailand is Wuchereria malayi.Nine species of mosquito (four of Mansonia and five of Anopheles) are vectors of W. malayi infection in Thailand. They are found naturally infected with the larval stages of W. malayi, the infection rates in the different vector species ranging between 3% and 17%. These mosquitos occur in large numbers and breed in the extensive marshes in the vicinity of the villages.The author discusses the feasibility of different measures for the control of filariasis. Under the conditions prevailing in the endemic areas of Thailand, the author considers that halting transmission by spraying dwellings with residual insecticides would be feasible as well as economical. This method was tried experimentally in a restricted area, and it was found that spraying all dwellings in a village with DDT, in a dosage of 170 mg per square foot (approximately 1.8 g per m(2)), effectively controlled the transmission of filarial infection and considerably lowered the incidence of vector mosquitos."}

Most lacerations (76% of 576) occurred on the hands and fingers (grouped as \"hand\" lacerations). On average, 37% of surveyed workers reported at least one laceration to the hand in the preceding year, resulting in an overall hand laceration rate of 83 per 100 workers per year. An inverse relationship was found between level of job routinization and hand lacerations, with progressively higher rates of hand lacerations occurring among workers assigned to less routine (more variable) work patterns. Fabricated metal parts handling and job variability may be related to increased risk of hand lacerations in line-paced work environments where personal protective equipment is the primary strategy to control exposure to sharp objects."}

Our recent in-vivo study indicates that antisense treatment against 47-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp47), a collagen-specific molecular chaperone, relieves scar formation following skin wounds in rats [Wang et al., Plast. Reconstr. Surg., in press]. In order to understand the mechanism of this phenomenon, we examined the effects of antisense treatment on the expression of mRNAs and proteins of Hsp47 and collagens in fibroblasts derived from wounded rat tongues. Hsp47 and procollagen alpha1(I) and alpha1(III) mRNAs were consistently increased after wounding and were maximal at day 5 post-injury. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotide against Hsp47 efficiently blocked the production of procollagen alpha2(I) and alpha1(III) proteins, but had little effect on their mRNA levels. Therefore, we conclude that antisense oligonucleotide against Hsp47 inhibits the production of procollagen type I and III proteins in fibroblasts derived from wounded tongues, overcoming the increase in their mRNAs."}

We postulated that polymorphisms (SNPs) in SREBP-2 gene might influence lipid parameters and the risk of coronary atherosclerosis. PCR-SSCP analysis and direct sequencing of DNA from 64 asymptomatic hypercholesterolemic men revealed seven genetic SREBP-2 SNPs. The genotype distribution of four of these SNPs (1668G>T, 1784G>C, 3474T>C and 3705C>T), and their influence on plasma lipid values and clinical parameters was studied in 655 asymptomatic men previously selected for the presence of at least one cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco consumption). No significant relation was found with lipid parameters but there was a significant association between the 1784G>C polymorphism and intima-media thickness (IMT) measured in 497 subjects. Thus, a common variation in the SREBP-2 gene is related with early-stage carotid atherosclerosis in subjects with a risk of cardiovascular events without detectable change in plasma lipid levels."}

Critics of the Committee felt it was deaf to apparently central moral considerations and focused on the self-serving purpose of expanding transplantation. Historical characterizations of the uses and meanings of brain death and the work of the Committee have tended to echo these themes, which means also generally repeating a widely held bioethical self-understanding of how the field appeared-that is, as a necessary antidote of moral expertise. This paper looks at the Committee and finds that historical depictions of it have been skewed by such a bioethical agenda. Entertaining different possibilities as to the motives and historical circumstances behind the Report it famously produced may point to not only different histories of the Committee, but also different perspectives on the historical legacy and role of bioethics as a discourse for addressing anxieties about medicine."}

Against this backdrop, the government is unlikely to provide state-of-the-art facilities for management of end-stage organ failure. The unequal distribution of wealth leaves more than 40% below the poverty line. Economic solutions are based on temporary fixes where foreign aid and loans keeps the government machinery operational. Many of the basic health measures such as immunization are also foreign funded. Under such a scenario, local philanthropy has come to play a vital role. SIUT developed a model based on self-help--a model based on a community-government partnership, where the doctor plays the pivotal role and the beneficiary is the patient. SIUT acquired funds by developing a community-government partnership. The government fulfills about 40% of the total budget and the rest comes from the community as donations. The scheme has been extremely successful in providing free medical care and renal support to thousands of patients. It has been sustained over the past 15 years through complete transparency, public audit and accountability. These confidence-building means stimulate the community to come forward and donate money, equipment and medicines. The goal of transplantation is to provide organs to all with long-term survival of the graft. The emerging challenges to achieve this goal and efforts that can be made to increase and sustain transplant activity in Pakistan require a concerted effort on the part of the government, society and the medical profession."}

Also, previously, very little was known about the developmental processes of the bronchial arteries in rats and other laboratory animals. In the present study, we dissected bronchial arteries of adult rats from their origin to the pulmonary hilus, and examined developmental processes of bronchial arteries in a series of rat embryos. We observed one right bronchial artery and one left bronchial artery. The right artery arose from the right highest intercostal artery, ran together with the right vagus nerve along the right side of the trachea and right principal bronchus and reached the pulmonary hilus. The left artery arose from the left internal thoracic artery, ran along the left vagus nerve on the ventral surface of the thoracic aorta, and reached the dorsal surface of the left principal bronchus. In a series of 12 to 20.5-day-old rat embryos, the right bronchial artery was clearly identified in 20.5, 18.5, and 16.5-day-old embryos. In a 15.5-day-old embryo, a vessel corresponding to the right bronchial artery was recognized within the capillary plexus extending along the right lateral surface of the bronchus. In ontogenetic development, there appears to be little difference in completion time of the extrapulmonary part of the bronchial arteries between humans and rats."}

However, the precise mechanisms by which the BNip proteins induce apoptosis and/or necrosis remain to be determined. To advance our knowledge, we have provided a summary and review of current literature regarding BNip proteins including comparative sequence analysis, mutational mapping of the functional domains, and cell death mechanisms involving disruption of mitochondrial homeostasis. Since BNip proteins are expressed at high levels in the heart as compared to other organs, their roles in cardiomyocyte injury during hypoxia or viral infection is a focus of this review.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of oligohydramnios on perinatal outcome in uncomplicated pregnancies between 40.0 and 41.6 weeks. From January 1997 to December 2000 all uncomplicated pregnancies reaching 40.0 weeks' gestation with a singleton non-malformed fetus and reliable dating underwent monitoring with serial determination of amniotic fluid index (AFI) and biophysical profile. Labor was induced for AFI <or=5 cm, biophysical profile score of 6 or less, rise in maternal blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg, or gestational age of 42.0 weeks. Perinatal outcome was compared between cases with AFI <or=5 cm and those with AFI >5 cm using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, Student's t-test for continuous variables, and logistic regression analysis. A two-tailed p value <0.05 or an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) not inclusive of the unity was considered significant. RESULTS. Three thousand and forty-nine women met the inclusion criteria, 341 of which (11%) had an AFI <or=5 cm. Gestational age at delivery, rates of nulliparity and induction of labor were significantly different between cases with oligohydramnios and those with normal AFI (all p<0.001). Rates of cesarean delivery for non-reassuring fetal testing (8.2% vs. 3.9%, p<0.001) and of neonates with birth weight <10th percentile (13.2% vs. 5.5%, p<0.001) were significantly higher in the AFI <or=5 cm group compared with the AFI >5 cm. No significant differences were identified between the two groups in rates of meconium-stained amniotic fluid, 5-min Apgar score <7, or umbilical artery pH <7. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the association between oligohydramnios and rate of cesarean delivery for non-reassuring fetal testing lost significance after controlling for gestational age at delivery, nulliparity and induction of labor, whereas the association between AFI <or=5 cm and low birth weight centiles remained statistically significant (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.5, 3.2). In conclusion, in uncomplicated pregnancies at 40.0 to 41.6 weeks, oligohydramnios is independently associated with a higher risk of low birth weight centile."}

The value of coronary flow velocity analyses during follow up after reperfusion has not been established in the clinical setting. To evaluate coronary flow velocity measurements in predicting recovery of regional left ventricular function during short term follow up after acute anterior myocardial infarction, using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE). 30 consecutive patients with anterior acute myocardial infarction were studied. They all underwent successful coronary angioplasty for lesions in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Using TTDE, coronary flow velocity in the LAD was recorded on days 1 and 3, and at one and two weeks after reperfusion. Regional wall motion was analysed by the wall motion score index (WMSI), calculated as an average of segmental scores in the LAD territory before reperfusion and one month after the infarction. Deceleration time of diastolic flow velocity (DDT) in patients with viable myocardium (WMSI in LAD territory at one month, < 2.0) was significantly longer after recanalisation than in patients without viable myocardium (WMSI in LAD territory at one month, > 2.0): 657 (226) v 271 (117) ms on day 1, p < 0.001; 732 (219) v 373 (217) ms on day 3, p < 0.01; and 903 (107) v 577 (300) ms at one week, p < 0.01. However, the difference at two weeks (991 (75) v 795 (281) ms) was not significant. For the prediction of viable myocardium, DDT > 600 ms had a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 92% on day 1, and a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 84% on day 3. At one and two weeks, DDT > 600 ms was sensitive (100% and 100%, respectively) but less specific (46% and 26%, respectively) for predicting viable myocardium.

Non-pharmacological management of migraine largely consists of lifestyle advice to help sufferers avoid situations in which attacks will be triggered. Preventive treatments for migraine should usually be considered on the basis of attack frequency, particularly its trend to change with time, and tract-ability to acute care. Acute care treatments for migraine can be divided into non-specific treatments (general analgesics, such as aspirin or non-steroidal anti--inflammatory drugs) and treatments relatively specific to migraine (ergotamine and the triptans). The triptans--sumatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, zolmitriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan and frovatriptan--are potent serotonin, 5-HT1B/1D, receptor agonists which represent a major advance in the treatment of acute migraine.

The multivariate model of time to Renal BG3 determined only a prior diagnosis of severe acute GVHD (RR=4.1, 95% CI 1.6-10.3, P=0.003) and VOD (RR=9.1, 95% CI 3.5-23.7, P<0.001) as significant independent predictors. Renal BG3 is generally considered a conditioning regimen-related toxicity. This study demonstrates that Renal BG3 is most commonly a complication of hepatic co-morbidities after allogeneic blood and marrow transplantation and identifies patients with a very poor prognosis."}

We also studied the cross-sectional relationships between medical conditions and movement performance at baseline, and longitudinal relationships between baseline medical conditions and changes of movement performance. Two hundred and thirty-four women aged 70 years participated in the baseline study, and 88 women participated in a follow-up study 8 years later. Movement performance was measured by an optoelectronic test, the postural-locomotor-manual (PLM) test, which objectively and precisely measures the subject's mobility of lower and upper extremities. Information on medical conditions including selected diseases and symptoms were obtained by self-report and/or by physical examination. Movement time (MT), an indicator of the overall movement performance of the PLM test, increased over 8 years. This change was mainly related to prolonged duration of the locomotor phase (walking forward), but not to the duration of the manual phase (goal-directed arm reaching). At baseline, poor PLM performance was related to hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, cerebrovascular diseases, chronic bronchitis, depression, arthritis, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, joint problems, leg pain, tiredness, number of diseases and number of symptoms at baseline. Increased MT during follow-up was associated with arthritis and dyspnea at baseline, and newly developed diseases during follow-up. Our study results indicated that 70-year-old women had a general slowing of their movement performance over 8 years. Age-related decrements of movement performance were more striking in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities. Arthritis and dyspnea at baseline, and incident diseases during follow-up were related to this age-related decline of movement performance."}

We propose a strategy called \"combination test\" that tests the association between a quantitative trait and all possible phased combinations of various numbers of SNPs. We compare this strategy to two alternative strategies: the association test that considers each SNP separately, and a multilocus genotype-based test that considers the phased combination of all SNPs together. To compare these three tests, a quantitative trait was simulated under different models of correspondence between phenotype and genotype, including the extreme case when two SNPs interact with no marginal effects of each SNP. The genotypes were taken from a sample of 290 independent individuals genotyped for three genes with various number of SNPs (from 5-8 SNPs). The results show that the \"combination test\" is the only one able to detect the association when the two SNPs involved in disease susceptibility interact with no marginal effects. Interestingly, even in the case of a single etiological SNP, the \"combination test\" performed well. We apply the three tests to Genetic Analysis Workshop 12 (Almasy et al. [2001] Genet. Epidemiol. 21:332-338) simulated data, and show that although there was no interactions between the etiological SNPs, the \"combination test\" was preferable to the two other compared methods to detect the role of the candidate gene."}

The method is presented for series of 2D acquisitions with Cartesian sampling. Using a reference k-space acquisition (corrected for translations) within the series, intra-scan motion parameters are accurately estimated for each trajectory in k-space of each data set in the series resulting in pseudo-random sample positions. The images are reconstructed with a Bayesian estimator that can handle sparse arbitrary sampling in k-space and reduces intra-scan rotation artefacts to the noise level. The method has been assessed by means of a Monte Carlo study on axial brain images for different signal-to-noise ratios. The accuracy of motion estimates is better than 0.1 degrees for rotation, and 0.1 and 0.05 pixel, respectively, for translation along the read and phase directions for signal-to-noise ratios higher than 6 of the signals on each trajectory. An example of reconstruction from experimental data corrupted by head motion is also given."}

One of the operative techniques is plate osteosynthesis, which can be performed in either a dorsal or a palmar plate position. This study reports on 122 fractures of the distal radius treated by open reduction and internal fixation with the T-plate, investigating the long-term outcome after an average period of 42.4 months. The follow-up examination contained a subjective, a clinical and a radiological part, and the results were evaluated according to the scores of Stewart and of Castaing with special emphasis on the question of whether palmar or dorsal plating showed any differences in outcome, and if so, what they were. The radiological results (Stewart 1 score; i.e. the anatomical reduction) were \"excellent\" or \"good\" in 87.7% of cases. There were significant differences with respect to age, gender and plate position: patients older than 80 years and women had significantly worse results, and dorsal plating was significantly better than palmar plating. The functional outcome (Stewart 2 score) was\"excellent\" and 'good' in 90.2% of cases. These functional results showed a tendency for dorsal plating to be better, but the differences were not significant. There was a close correlation between the radiological and the clinical findings. With the Castaing score, which combines both functional and radiological outcomes, there were 73.8% perfect and good results. This study shows that the majority of patients with problem fractures of the distal radius can be successfully treated by internal fixation using the T-plate. The dorsal approach to the distal radius--in cases where dorsal plating is appropriate--will result in a better anatomical reduction and clinical outcome."}

However, when the fructose concentration exceeds 150 g/L, the volumetric mannitol production rate decreases because of a lag in mannitol production, and the yield decreases as a result of the formation of side products. In fed-batch culture, the volumetric production rate and mannitol yield from fructose vary substantially with the fructose concentration and are maximal at a controlled fructose concentration of 50 g/L. In continuous feeding experiments, the maximum mannitol yield was 85% (g/g) at a glucose/fructose feeding ratio of 1/20. A high glucose concentration in the production phase resulted in the formation of ethanol followed by a decrease in yield and productivity. NAD(P)H-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity from C. magnoliae. In vitro, mannitol dehydrogenase was inhibited by increasing ethanol concentration. Mannitol product was also found to be inhibitory with a K(i) of 183 mM. Under optimum conditions, a final mannitol production of 213 g/L was obtained from 250 g fructose/L after 110 h."}

However, \"anarchic workers\", which can evade both mechanisms, have been detected at low frequency in several honeybee populations. Worker bees of the Cape honeybee, Apis mellifera capensis, also show this anarchistic trait but to an extreme degree. They can develop into so called \"pseudoqueens\", which release a pheromonal bouquet very similar to that of queens. They prime and release very similar reactions in sterile workers to those of true queens (e.g. suppress ovary activation; release retinue behavior). Here we show in an experimental bioassay that lethal fights between these parasitic workers and the queen (similar to queen-queen fights) occur, resulting in the death of either queen or worker. Although it is usually the queen that attacks the parasitic workers and kills many of them, in a few cases the workers succeeded in killing the queen. If this also occurs in a parasitized colony where the queen encounters many parasitic workers, she may eventually be killed in one of the repeated fights she engages in."}

Wetland plants have developed physiological and morphological adaptations for growing under these conditions. Various methods exist for measuring plant responses to reducing conditions in wetland and aquatic environments, including assessment of radial oxygen transport, cellular enzymatic transformations, changes in root structure, and nutrient uptake. However, a gap exists in quantifying the chemical properties and reducing nature of soil environment in which plant roots are grown. The variation in reducing conditions, oxygen demand, and other associated processes that occur in wetland soils makes it difficult to truly compare the plant responses reported in the literature. This review emphasizes soil-plant interactions in wetlands, drawing attention to the importance of quantifying the intensity and capacity of reduction and/or oxygen demand in wetland soils to allow proper evaluation of wetland plant responses to such conditions."}

{"pmid": "13680539", "title": "Toxic nephropathy: environmental chemicals.", "abstract": "The kidney is the target of numerous xenobiotic toxicants, including environmental chemicals. Anatomical, physiological, and biochemical features of the kidney make it particularly sensitive to many environmental compounds. Factors contributing to the sensitivity of the kidney include: large blood flow, the presence of a variety of xenobiotic transporters and metabolizing enzymes, and concentration of solutes during urine production. In many cases, the conjugation of environmental chemicals to glutathione and/or cysteine targets these chemicals to the kidney where inhibition of renal function occurs through a variety of mechanisms. For example, heavy metals such as mercury and cadmium target the kidney after glutathione/cysteine conjugation. Trichloroethlene and bromobenzene are metabolized and conjugated to glutathione in the liver before renal uptake and toxicity. In contrast, renal injury produced by chloroform and aristolochic acids is dependent on renal cytochrome P450 metabolism to toxic metabolites. Other compounds, such as paraquat or diquat, damage the kidney via the production of reactive oxygen species. Finally, the low solubility of ethylene glycol metabolites causes crystal formation within the tubular lumen and nephrotoxicity. This chapter explores mechanisms of nephrotoxicity by environmental chemicals, using these example compounds. What remains to be accomplished and by far the most difficult process is the elucidation of the detailed mechanisms of tubular cell injury after toxicant uptake and metabolism. The large number of individuals experiencing a decline in renal function with age makes the search for these mechanisms very compelling."}

Complications include respiratory failure, atelectasis, pneumonia, neurogenic shock, autonomic dysreflexia, venous thromboembolism, and sepsis. While complications may be managed with supportive care, the goal of ameliorating neurologic outcome has proved elusive. Methylprednisolone, when instituted <8 hours after traumatic spinal cord injury, was associated in two clinical trials with statistically significant improvements in motor scores at 6 months and 1 year; however, critical reappraisal of these data raises questions about their validity and clinical relevance. Until more evidence of clinically effective therapies is available, acute management must be driven by pathophysiologic principles, with emphasis on interventions that attenuate secondary neurologic injury; these include the rational use of immobilization, cautious airway management, and promotion of cord perfusion and oxygenation with the appropriate level of hemodynamic and respiratory support. Clinical trials of pharmacologic neuroprotection have yielded disappointing results, but the ongoing elucidation of spinal cord repair and regenerative mechanisms suggests new therapeutic prospects."}

Definitive local treatments such as surgery and radiation therapy cure only a minority of these patients. As a result, efforts are being made to reduce the risk of recurrence by using chemotherapy and new agents before, during or after definitive local therapy. Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy has yielded disappointing results when combined with surgery. Chemotherapy in the management of localized disease is evolving, and preliminary studies are just now being completed. Although these agents have established activity and acceptable toxicity in the hormone-refractory setting, more extensive use of them in patients with androgen-dependent disease will require data from randomized studies to determine overall efficacy. New molecular-targeted therapies are promising and hold the greatest hope that outcomes in early disease may be improved with early use of systemic therapy. The neoadjuvant surgical model also has promise in assessing the activity of new drugs, because it provides a means to determine molecular effects of specific agents, along with standard pathologic and clinical parameters of efficacy."}

Here, for the first time, field-generated high-speed video recordings and acoustic analyses are used to test numerous competing hypotheses of the kinematics underlying sonations, or non-vocal communicative sounds, produced by two genera of Pipridae, Manacus and Pipra (Aves). Eleven behaviorally and acoustically distinct sonations are characterized, five of which fall into a specific acoustic class of relatively loud, brief, broad-frequency sound pulses, or snaps. The hypothesis that one kinematic mechanism of snap production is used within and between birds in general, and manakins specifically, is rejected. Instead, it is verified that three of four competing hypotheses of the kinematic mechanisms used for producing snaps, namely: (1). above-the-back wing-against-wing claps, (2). wing-against-body claps and (3). wing-into-air flicks, are employed between these two clades, and a fourth mechanism, (4). wing-against-tail feather interactions, is discovered. The kinematic mechanisms used to produce snaps are invariable within each identified sonation, despite the fact that a diversity of kinematic mechanisms are used among sonations. The other six sonations described are produced by kinematic mechanisms distinct from those used to create snaps, but are difficult to distinguish from each other and from the kinematics of flight. These results provide the first detailed kinematic information on mechanisms of sonation in birds in general, and the Pipridae specifically. Further, these results provide the first evidence that acoustically similar avian sonations, such as brief, broad frequency snaps, can be produced by diverse kinematic means, both among and within species. The use of high-speed video recordings in the field in a comparative manner documents the diversity of kinematic mechanisms used to sonate, and uncovers a hidden, sexually selected radiation of behavioral and communicative diversity in the Pipridae."}

All the patients had one or two brain metastases, 30 mm or less in diameter, and only one isocentre was used for RS. There were 23 females and 38 males. The median age was 54 years (34-76). The median Karnofsky performance status was 80 (60-100). At the time of RS, 23 patients had no evidence of extracranial disease and 38 had a progressive systemic disease. Thirty-eight patients were treated up-front with only RS. Twenty-three patients were treated for relapse or progression more than 2 months after whole brain radiotherapy. From January 1994 to July 1995, clinical target volume (CTV) was equal to GTV without any margin (33 metastases). From August 1995 to August 2000, CTV was defined as GTV plus a 1 mm margin (45 metastases). A dose of 20Gy was prescribed to the isocentre and 14Gy at the margin of CTV. The median follow-up was 10.5 months (1-45). The mean minimum dose delivered to GTV was 14.6Gy in the group without a margin and 16.8Gy in the group with a 1 mm margin (P<0.0001). The response of 11 metastases was never assessed because patients died before the first follow-up. Ten metastases recurred, eight in the group treated without a margin and two in the group treated with a 1 mm margin (P=0.01). Two-year local control rates were 50.7+/-12.7% and 89.7+/-7.4% (P=0.008), respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the treatment group (P=0.008) and the tumour volume (P=0.009) were prognostic factors for local control. In multivariate analysis, only the treatment group with a 1 mm margin was an independent prognostic factor for local control (P=0.04, RR: 5.8, 95% CI [1.08-31.13]). There were no significant differences, either in overall survival rate or in early and late side effects, between the two groups. Adding a 1 mm margin to the GTV in patients treated with RS significantly improves the probability of metastasis control without increasing the side effects."}

Our previous studies showed that elemene had a markedly antineoplastic activity on glioma. This study was designed to investigate the proliferation inhibitory effect and the apoptosis-inducing activity of elemene on glioma cells. The effects of elemene on cell proliferation were studied in vitro by using (3)H-TdR incorporation. The morphological alterations were confirmed by Hoechst 33258/PI staining. The apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Elemene exhibited a marked antiproliferative effect on rat glioma cell C6 and human glioma cell SHG-44. The fifty percent inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of elemene against glioma cell lines at different time points (D1-D4) by (3)H-TdR incorporation was C6 7.33-11.02 mg/L, SHG-44 13.29-27.16 mg/L. At the same concentration, human glioma cell line SHG-44 was found to be less sensitive to elemene compared to rodent cell line C6. The characteristic nucleolus alternations under fluorescent microscope included condensation of chromatin arranged under the nuclear membrane and apoptotic bodies, with a low nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio. In flow cytometry analysis, a typical subdiploid peak before Phase G(0)/G(1) (apoptotic peak) was detected in DNA frequency distribution histograms. Also the apoptosis in glioma cells was confirmed by DNA ladder formation on gel electrophoresis. Elemene exhibited a marked antiproliferative effect on glioma cells, and it could induce apoptosis in vitro."}

To extend these studies to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), we focused on an AA (L262) located in the same region of the second transmembrane domain of the alpha2 subunit of neuronal nAChRs. Single-point mutation of alpha2L262 was carried out, the resulting alpha2 subunits co-expressed with wild-type beta4 subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and studied using two-electrode voltage clamp. Ethanol enhancement of ACh responses was diminished [alpha2(L262F)beta4] or abolished [alpha2(L262G)beta4, alpha2(L2625)beta4 and alpha2(L262A)beta4]. Mutation of the homologous AA in beta4 [beta4(L258A)] did not modify the ethanol modulation and the mutation in alpha2 was dominant, because ethanol did not enhance ACh responses in alpha2(L262A)beta4(L258A) nAChRs. n-Alcohols (ethanol through octanol) were applied to alpha2(L262A)beta4 nAChRs. As described previously for other nAChRs, short-chain alcohols enhanced, intermediate-chain alcohols had no effect and long-chain alcohols inhibited ACh responses in the wild-type receptor. For alpha2(L262A)beta4 nAChRs the alcohol enhancing effect was absent, and the alcohol inhibitory action was increased. Although this suggests removal of an alcohol enhancing site through mutagenesis, we cannot rule out the enhancement of action at an alcohol inhibitory site."}

In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which Tam increases p27(Kip1) expression. Because intracellular p27(Kip1) protein level is mainly controlled via posttranslational regulation, we first tested whether Tam might affect protein stability of p27(Kip1). Metabolic labeling and pulse chase assays showed that Tam did not affect the half-life of this protein. We next examined whether Tam enhanced p27(Kip1) expression through transcriptional activation. Our results demonstrated that Tam directly stimulated the p27(Kip1) promoter in lung cancer cells. Deletion and mutation analysis revealed that two Sp1 consensus sites located between -545 and -532bp from the transcription start site were crucial for the induction of p27(Kip1) by Tam. Conversely, mutation in a CTF site (-525/-520) nearby these two Sp1 sites had little effect. Electromobility shift assays showed that Sp1 transcription factor bound to these consensus sites and the DNA binding activity of Sp1 was enhanced by Tam. Our data also demonstrated that induction of p27(Kip1) by Tam was inhibited by protein kinase A inhibitor H89, but not by protein kinase C inhibitor calphostin C and mitogen-activated kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059. Taken together, our results suggest that Tam transcriptionally activates p27(Kip1) expression via the Sp1 consensus sites in the p27(Kip1) promoter and PKA is involved in this process."}

The present study further characterizes the biochemical mechanism for HLA-DR-mediated programmed cell death of tumor cells. Phosphatidylserine exposure on the plasma membrane and propidium iodide incorporation occur with very rapid kinetics and are observed as early as 10 min after the induction of cell death with anti-HLA-DR. In striking contrast to anti-CD95, we observe no activation of caspase-3, -8, or -9 upon anti-HLA-DR addition. Furthermore, the irreversible caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk also failed to inhibit anti-HLA-DR-mediated cell death, further supporting the conclusion that HLA-DR induces cell death via a caspase-independent mechanism. We demonstrate that anti-HLA-DR-induced cell death is instead associated with a rapid disruption of the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential, DeltaPsi(m), a process that is significantly inhibited by Bcl-2 overexpression. Furthermore, we find that DeltaPsi(m) disruption results in the selective release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria. We propose that AIF is acting to initiate the morphological and biochemical changes observed in HLA-DR-mediated cell death."}

Experimental data from tracer injections as well as data from hydraulic parameters were used to calculate the dispersion coefficient. Two methods based on tracer curves fit the experimental data well. One method is based on the time at which the tracer concentration is half the maximum concentration; the other method is based on the variance of the tracer curve distribution. An alternative method based on governmental data of velocity profiles and correlations of hydraulic parameters was also used. The results of this method are strongly sensitive to small variations in the stream flowrate. A new correlation is proposed to predict the dispersion coefficient with an error smaller than the one provided by other correlations in the literature."}

DESIGN AND SETTING: Subjects retracted the face mask of a football helmet mounted to a force platform in a laboratory setting. They removed a standard face mask by cutting or removing (or both) the lateral plastic loop straps using 4 different tools: the Trainer's Angel (TA), FM Extractor (FM), power screwdriver (SD), and Quick Release System (QR) in a counterbalanced fashion. SUBJECTS: Eighteen certified athletic trainers participated in this study. MEASUREMENTS: We started measuring time when the subject picked up the tool and ended when the face mask was in a fully retracted position. Maximum forces and torques were measured from the force platform during the retraction process. RESULTS: The SD and QR retracted the face mask significantly faster than the TA and FM. Forces producing superior-inferior translation were least with the SD. The SD and QR produced less lateral translation and rotation and lateral flexion moment than the TA and FM. The FM produced less torque in the lateral flexion moment than the TA. CONCLUSIONS: Tools that removed the loop straps (SD, QR) were faster and produced less force and torque on the helmet than the tools that cut through the loop straps (TA, FM)."}

In this review we analyze the published data for the optimal dose and duration of treatment. In three different studies, iloprost given for 5 days in the highest tolerated dose of 1-2 ng/kg/min provided a significant improvement of the disease measured by the number and intensity of Raynaud attacks, healing of digital ulcers, and digital perfusion. This improvement lasted for about one month. When the infusions were repeated once a month, treatment effect could be maintained. Although the effect of this treatment regimen should be proven in further long-term studies, we think that an intermittent continuous therapy with iloprost could result in an improvement or stabilization of systemic sclerosis."}

This is a retrospective review of tracheostomy complications over a 10 year period (1991-2002) in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology (ORL), University College Hospital, Ibadan. A total of 179 tracheostomies performed on 168 patients with 69 complications (38.6%) were documented. There was a significantly greater number of complications in the 43 emergency cases (54%) than in the 26 elective cases 1(46%), P = 0.0002]. The overall mortality rate was 2.2%. The most common complications of tracheostomy were infective in origin, representing 43% of all complications. This study highlights the complications and mortality and gives details of management that will prevent or minimize their occurrences. Those who require long-term tracheostomy must be on regular follow-up and taught home-care of the tracheostomy before discharge from the hospital."}
{"pmid": "12781660", "title": "Accurate determination of local defocus and specimen tilt in electron microscopy.", "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of defocus and tilt parameters is essential for the determination of three-dimensional protein structures at high resolution using electron microscopy. We present two computer programs, CTFFIND3 and CTFTILT, which determine defocus parameters from images of untilted specimens, as well as defocus and tilt parameters from images of tilted specimens, respectively. Both programs use a simple algorithm that fits the amplitude modulations visible in a power spectrum with a calculated contrast transfer function (CTF). The background present in the power spectrum is calculated using a low-pass filter. The background is then subtracted from the original power spectrum, allowing the fitting of only the oscillatory component of the CTF. CTFTILT determines specimen tilt parameters by measuring the defocus at a series of locations on the image while constraining them to a single plane. We tested the algorithm on images of two-dimensional crystals by comparing the results with those obtained using crystallographic methods. The images also contained contrast from carbon support film that added to the visibility of the CTF oscillations. The tests suggest that the fitting procedure is able to determine the image defocus with an error of about 10nm, whereas tilt axis and tilt angle are determined with an error of about 2 degrees and 1 degrees, respectively. Further tests were performed on images of single protein particles embedded in ice that were recorded from untilted or slightly tilted specimens. The visibility of the CTF oscillations from these images was reduced due to the lack of a carbon support film. Nevertheless, the test results suggest that the fitting procedure is able to determine image defocus and tilt angle with errors of about 100 nm and 6 degrees, respectively."}

This led to the typical topographical and functional changes in the organs affected. Treatment has been very controversial. Surgical measures such as exeresis of the fat tissue with or without the intrapelvic organs affected by the abnormal fat deposition with subsequent drainage (colostomy/ileum conduit) were carried out. Conservative treatment with or without temporary cortisone administration was recommended. Pelvic lipomatosis is diagnosed radiologically. If there is no unequivocal restriction in the function of the affected organs, treatment should remain conservative."}
{"pmid": "12974641", "title": "Catalytic mechanism of dichloromethane dehalogenase from Methylophilus sp. strain DM11.", "abstract": "The glutathione (GSH)-dependent dichloromethane dehalogenase from Methylophilus sp. strain DM11 catalyzes the dechlorination of CH(2)Cl(2) to formaldehyde via a highly reactive, genotoxic intermediate, S-(chloromethyl)glutathione (GS-CH(2)Cl). The catalytic mechanism of the enzyme toward a series of dihalomethane and monohaloethane substrates suggests that the initial addition of GSH to the alkylhalides is fast and that the rate-limiting step in turnover is the release of either the peptide product or formaldehyde. With the exception of CH(2)ClF, which forms a relatively stable GS-CH(2)F intermediate, the turnover numbers for a series of dihalomethanes fall in a very narrow range (1-3 s(-1)). The pre-steady-state kinetics of the DM11-catalyzed addition of GSH to CH(3)CH(2)Br exhibits a burst of S-(ethyl)-glutathione (k(b) = 96 +/- 56 s(-1)) followed by a steady state with k(cat) = 0.13 +/- 0.01 s(-1). The turnover numbers for CH(3)CH(2)Cl, CH(3)CH(2)Br, and CH(3)CH(2)I are identical, indicating a common rate-limiting step. The turnover numbers of the enzyme with CH(3)CH(2)Br and CH(3)CH(2)I are dependent on viscosity and are very close to the measured off-rate of GSEt. The turnover number with CH(2)I(2) is also dependent on viscosity, suggesting that a diffusive step is rate-limiting with dihaloalkanes as well. The rate constants for solvolysis of CH(3)SCH(2)Cl, a model for GS-CH(2)Cl, range between 1 s(-1) (1:1 dioxane/water) and 64 s(-1) (1:10 dioxane/water). Solvolysis of the S-(halomethyl)glutathione intermediates may also occur in the active site of the enzyme preventing the release of the genotoxic species. Together, the results indicate that dissociation of the GS-CH(2)X or GS-CH(2)OH intermediates from the enzyme may be a relatively rare event."}

On memory tests administered within 1 hr of stimulus presentation, cortisol elevations caused a reduction in the number of errors committed on free-recall tasks. Two evenings later, when cortisol levels were no longer manipulated, inverted-U quadratic trends were found for recognition memory tasks, reflecting memory facilitation in the 20-mg group for both negative and neutral information. Results suggest that the effects of cortisol on memory do not differ substantially for emotional and neutral information. The study provides evidence of beneficial effects of acute cortisol elevations on explicit memory in humans."}

The calculated IN did not change when we compared these figures with those obtained in dogs while they were submitted to graded exercise on a treadmill. In both instances, rest and exercise, the constancy of the IN prevailed, in accordance with Cannon's principle of \"homeostasis\" (1929). On the contrary, when dogs were examined during a standardized hypovolemic shock, we observed a breakdown of the IN, and the resulting DN evolved as a reliable index of the condition of \"heterostasis\" as defined by H. Selye. The robustness of the homeostatic regulations is based on high-gain integral feedback mechanisms, while \"heterostasis\" could be associated with low-gain integral feedback processes, when organisms are submitted to unitary step disturbances or to changes of the set-point at the entrance of the feedback loop."}

It can occur at any age, but its peak onset is in childhood. The natural course of this atopic disorder varies, but tends to improve with time. Genetic and environmental factors play a role in its development. There are effective treatments including pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy. Allergen avoidance is difficult, but should be attempted. Future therapies will likely focus on downregulation of the Th2 immune phenotype and possibly upregulation of the Th1 response. Treating this condition is a daunting task; therefore, interventions to prevent atopy are appealing. Future therapies and studies will likely also focus on this issue. (c) 2001 Prous Science.

Molybdenum as a micronutrient for Nitrobacter. J. Bacteriol. 89:123-128. 1965.-The requirement of Nitrobacter for molybdenum was investigated by use of a medium purified by chemical means, as well as by depletion by the prior growth of this autotrophic bacterium. During 5 days of growth, added molybdenum induced an approximately 11-fold increase in both nitrite utilization and cell-mass development. In short-term studies, maximal response was obtained with concentrations as low as 10(-9)m. No other metal tested substituted for molybdenum. It is estimated that a minimum of 2,000 atoms of molybdenum is required for the synthesis of one Nitrobacter cell. Molybdenum did not directly influence the thermodynamic efficiency of Nitrobacter. The efficiency of molybdenum-deficient cultures and of cultures supplied with the micronutrient declined equally during the early stage of development, despite large differences in the amount of nitrite consumed. After the utilization of about 100 mumoles of nitrite per ml, cultures supplied with molybdenum became relatively less efficient. A procedure is described whereby large masses of Nitrobacter cells can be obtained with relative ease."}

To review the course, risk factors, and management of 10 patients with microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) and to compare treatment outcome by either Mohs micrographic surgery or standard surgical excision. Tumor registry databases were used to identify cases at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York. Fifteen cases that were coded as MAC were reviewed. Ten cases were subsequently confirmed to be MAC. From these cases, data were collected on patient demographics, tumor location and size, risk exposure, metastasis, treatment, and recurrence of tumors. The average age of the patients was 63.4, and females outnumbered males seven to three. Nine tumors were located on the head and neck area. Five patients had a history of radiation therapy, and two patients were sisters. The first-time procedure was Mohs micrographic surgery in four cases and surgical excision in six cases. Three patients in the surgical excision group needed a second procedure, two of whom thereafter underwent Mohs micrographic surgery. In the Mohs micrographic surgery group, none of the patients required a second procedure, and all of the patients were disease free at an average of 23.3 months. One recurrence was noted in the surgical excision group, and the average follow-up was 32 months. This report supports the use of Mohs micrographic surgery for tumor control with the least possible procedures. Risk factors appear to include radiation treatment, ultraviolet exposure, and possibly genetics."}

The sample population consisted of two groups of women: patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa or bulimia, but no other psychiatric pathology, seen by psychiatrists at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubirán), and a randomly selected sample of women from a school in Mexico City. A structured interview was conducted using SCID/DSM-IV as the gold standard. Finally the EDI-2 was administered. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for independent samples, Cronbach's alpha test, and calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. No significant differences were found for weight, height, and body mass index. Women with no eating disorders were younger than those with eating disorders (16.7 +/- 2.8 vs. 19.9 +/- 4.3, p = 0.004). The EDI-2 total score was clearly different between the groups (53.8 +/- 32.4 vs. 146.3 +/- 45.6 respectively, p < 0.001). All Cronbach's alpha coefficients for all subscales were over 0.85. For the total score, a sensitive cutoff point of 80 (sensitivity 90.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 69.4 to 98.4; specificity 80, 95% CI 58.7 to 92.4) and a specific cutoff point of 105 (sensitivity 81.8, 95% CI 59 to 94; specificity 89.3, 95% CI 70.6 to 97.2) are recommended.

The complete process by which COAT platelets are produced is still not clear, although significant recent progress has been made. COAT platelets retain several procoagulant proteins on their surface by a previously unrecognized mechanism involving transglutaminase mediated conjugation of serotonin to released alpha-granule proteins. Fibrinogen and thrombospondin have been found to bind serotonin-conjugated proteins and thereby provide the requisite link for stabilization of serotonin-derivatized, procoagulant proteins on COAT platelets. Multivalent interactions, resulting from traditional receptor interactions and binding of conjugated serotonin by fibrinogen and thrombospondin, result in exceptionally strong retention of procoagulant alpha-granule proteins on the surface of COAT platelets. The physiologic significance of this new subclass of platelets remains to be determined."}

We investigated the effect of interferon beta-1a on disability in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), using the FIM instrument to assess levels of decline in total, motor, and cognitive items. Of the 301 patients enrolled in the trial, 274 subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with baseline FIM and Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale scores were studied in this secondary analysis. Mildly disabled patients were chosen, as indicated by a Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 1.0-3.5. Matched subjects were assigned to receive either interferon beta-1a or placebo. Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale and FIM scores were measured serially every 6 mo. Failure was defined as a 4-point reduction in total FIM score sustained for 6 mo. Analysis was by Kaplan-Meier methodology. The Mann-Whitney test (log rank) compared mean change and Spearman's rank-correlation test determined correlation. A significant difference in treatment groups was seen, with a FIM score decline of > or = 4 points, with placebo subjects demonstrating greater loss of function than subjects treated with interferon beta-1a. There was no statistically significant difference in total, cognitive, or motor activities, with a decline of < or = 3 points. Disability, as measured by the FIM instrument, was slowed by treatment with interferon beta-1a compared with placebo. The treatment effect determined using the FIM instrument, with its motor and cognitive components, indicates an additional level of response to therapy for mild to moderate multiple sclerosis."}

UBB+1 is able block the 26S proteasome in cell lines. Proteasome inhibition by drug action has previously been shown to induce a heat-shock response and render protection against stress. We investigated UBB+1 by developing a stable, conditional expression model in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Induction of UBB+1 expression caused proteasome inhibition as was confirmed by reduced ability to process misfolded canavanyl proteins, accumulation of GFPu, a proteasome substrate, and reduced cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate. We show that expression of UBB+1 induces expression of heat-shock proteins. This priming of the chaperone system in these cells promotes a subsequent resistance to tert-butyl hydroperoxide-mediated oxidative stress. We conclude that although UBB+1-expressing cells have a compromised ubiquitin-proteasome system, they are protected against oxidative stress conditions."}

The purpose of this study was to describe secular changes that might have occurred in tooth sizes and tooth size-arch length relationships in the same cohorts of contemporary and historical North American white children in the deciduous dentition. The 2 samples were similar in terms of geographic location, racial and ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic status. Both samples were restricted to white children with a normal overjet (<4 mm) and a normal anteroposterior molar relationship, no anterior open bite, and no crossbite. In addition, subjects were excluded if any permanent teeth were erupted. Measurements of mesiodistal tooth sizes and arch lengths of maxillary and mandibular arches were made, and tooth size-arch length discrepancies (TSALD) were determined. The results indicated that tooth sizes were generally similar in the 2 cohorts but slightly larger in contemporary children. Crowding, as measured by TSALD, was found to be common in the mandibular arch for contemporary children in the deciduous dentition of both boys and girls. Moreover, crowding was much more common and severe in contemporary children compared with children in the historical cohort. Further research is needed to determine whether the increase in mandibular crowding in the deciduous dentition will continue to be observed in the mixed and permanent dentitions and to further establish these possible secular trends."}

These RNA motifs have considerable structural and functional overlap. In this study, we investigate the conformational dynamics associated with the use and silencing of a sequence in HIV-2 RNA that is involved in genomic RNA dimerization called stem-loop 1 (SL1) and its relationship with a flanking sequence that is known to be important for encapsidation of viral RNAs. We demonstrate that a long-distance intramolecular interaction between nucleotides located upstream of the primer-binding site domain and nucleotides encompassing the Gag translation start codon functionally silences SL1 as a dimerization element. This silencing can be relieved by mutation or by hybridization of an oligonucleotide that disrupts the long-distance interaction. Furthermore, we identify a palindrome within the packaging/encapsidation signal Psi (just 5' of SL1) that can either serve as an efficient dimerization signal itself, or can mediate SL1 silencing through base pairing with SL1. These results provide a tangible link between the functions of genomic RNA dimerization and encapsidation, which are known to be related, but whose physical relationship has been unclear. A model is proposed that accounts for observations of dimerization, packaging, and translation of viral RNAs during different phases of the viral replication cycle."}

Comparative measurements were made on 40 adult Thai skulls and their companion mandibles using lateral cephalometric radiographs, linear tomography, and direct measurements of the dento-alveolar and basal structures. Wide variation was found in facio-lingual widths of the alveolar bases. No significant correlations were found between the facio-lingual widths of the anterior and posterior alveolar bases in the maxillae and mandible. Significant inverse correlations were found between the alveolar base widths at the mandibular incisors and the FP-MP and PP-MP angles, and between maxillary incisor base widths and the gonial angle. Importantly, no cephalometric indicators were found to predict posterior alveolar base widths. There is a need to continue to search for assessment indicators."}

We present the first prospective clinical study of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) detection using the FPBtot assay, which measures fibrinopeptide B and its first derivative, des-arginine fibrinopeptide B. Twenty three patients with signs or symptoms of PE or DVT were enrolled in the study prior to the performance of definitive testing. Using a novel immunoassay, FPBtot levels were measured in urine and plasma samples from patients as well as from healthy controls. Urine and plasma FPBtot levels were compared to the diagnostic results, as blindly adjudicated by one of the investigators. Patients were excluded if they withdrew (n =1), had inconclusive diagnostic testing (n = 7), or did not give samples (n = 2 for urine, n = 3 for plasma). The mean FPBtot concentration in the urine of the 'DVT/PE positive' group was 78.4 +/- 35.2 ng/ml and 2.7 +/- 1.9 ng/ml in the 'DVT/PE negative' group (p = 0.03). The urine FPB(tot) concentrations in the 'DVT/PE negative' group were not significantly different from those in the healthy control group (2.2 +/- 0.4 ng/ml, p = 0.40). The area under the ROC curve for urine FPB(tot) concentrations was 97.3 +/- 3.8%, suggesting a high degree of diagnostic accuracy.

GENERAL FEATURES AND CUTANEOUS LESIONS.", "abstract": "The cutaneous lesions of adult rats with homologous disease are described, and evidence is presented to indicate that they have an immunologic basis. The skin changes included erythema, purpura, edema, and a variety of inflammatory lesions. In the more active lesions, dermal infiltration, hydropic degeneration, acanthosis, and atrophy of the epidermis with hyperkeratosis and follicular plugging were present. In some cases, ulceration and sloughing were also observed. More chronic lesions were characterized by atrophy of the epidermis and collagenization of the dermis with disappearance of the skin appendages. Rejection of autografts was observed simultaneously with acceptance of homografts. The histologic appearance of autografts undergoing rejection was similar to that of the spontaneous skin lesions, suggesting that the latter, too, had an immunologic basis. In favor of this, also, was the specificity of the dermatitis for the skin of the host, with sparing of neighboring homograft tissue. There was a histologic similarity between the spontaneous skin lesions of homologous disease and those of lupus erythematosus on the one hand, and scleroderma on the other, thus supporting the possibility that the cutaneous lesions of these connective tissue diseases of man may also have an immunologic basis. It was concluded that the adult rat with homologous disease may furnish a model for human autoimmune disease."}

We recruited 294 asymptomatic patients (mean age 42 +/- 9 years, 49% men, mean mantle irradiation dose 43 +/- 0.3 Gy) treated with at least 35 Gy to the mediastinum for Hodgkin's disease. After providing written consent, each patient underwent electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography. Valvular disease was common and increased with time following irradiation. Patients who had received irradiation more than 20 years before evaluation had significantly more mild or greater aortic regurgitation (60% vs. 4%, p < 0.0001), moderate or greater tricuspid regurgitation (4% vs. 0%, p = 0.06), and aortic stenosis (16% vs. 0%, p = 0.0008) than those who had received irradiation within 10 years. The number needed to screen to detect one candidate for endocarditis prophylaxis was 13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7 to 44) for patients treated within 10 years and 1.6 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.9) for those treated at least 20 years ago. Compared with the Framingham Heart Study population, mildly reduced left ventricular fractional shortening (<30%) was more common (36% vs. 3%), and age- and gender-adjusted left ventricular mass was lower (90 +/- 27 g/m vs. 117 g/m) in irradiated patients. There is a high prevalence of asymptomatic heart disease in general, and aortic valvular disease in particular, following mediastinal irradiation.

At the molecular level the biological clock is based on the rhythmic expression of clock genes. Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS-containing transcription factors, CLOCK and BMAL1 (MOP3), provide the basic drive to the system by activating transcription of negative regulators through E box enhancer elements. A critical feature of circadian timing is the ability of the clockwork to be entrained to the environmental light/dark cycle. The light-resetting mechanism of the mammalian circadian clock is poorly understood. Light-induced phase shifts are correlated with the induction of the clock genes mPer1 and mPer2 and a subsequent increase in mPER1 protein levels. It has previously been suggested that rapid degradation of BMAL1 protein in the rat SCN is part of the resetting mechanism of the central pacemaker. Our study shows that BMAL1 and CLOCK proteins are continuously expressed at high levels in the mouse SCN, supporting the hypothesis that rhythmic negative feedback plays the major role in rhythm generation in the mammalian pacemaker. Using both immunocytochemistry and immunoblot analysis, our studies demonstrate that BMAL1 protein in the mouse SCN is not affected by a phase-resetting light pulse. These results indicate that rapid degradation of BMAL1 protein is not a consistent feature of resetting mechanisms in rodents."}

A cohort with bone lesions as the only metastatic side showed a correlation as follows: 7 of the 11 patients (64%) had negative findings in BM and PB, whereas cytokeratin-positive cells in PB were present in 3 of these 11 patients (27%). The presence of visceral metastases was associated with the detection of cytokeratin-positive cells in the PB in 20 of the 31 patients (65%) in this subgroup. The density gradient OncoQuick in combination with immunocytochemical staining allows the detection of cytokeratin-positive cells in PB of patients with advanced breast cancer. The immunocytochemical detection of cytokeratin-positive cells in PB seems to be associated with the site of metastatic manifestation."}

These antigens can be grouped into different classes according to their specificities, with cancer/testis antigens appearing to be the most attractive candidates for vaccine development. The observation that CD8 and CD4 T-cell responses against cancer/testis antigens such as NY-ESO-1 correlate with the presence of specific antibodies demonstrates the importance of serological monitoring patients participating in vaccine trials. However, all serological assays available (Western blot, phage display and ELISA) are hampered by the fact that the protein cannot be analyzed in its natural conformation. We have thus developed a yeast display system where the antigen is expressed on the yeast surface (RAYS), allowing for a more natural folding of the protein. To validate this approach we displayed the A33 colorectal cancer antigen on the yeast cell surface and demonstrated specific binding by an A33 monoclonal antibody recognizing a conformation-dependent epitope on the A33 antigen. We then compared RAYS with the more commonly used ELISA and Western blot serological monitoring methods by analyzing 50 sera from cancer patients with known NY-ESO-1 antibody status and 10 sera from patients with unknown SSX2 antibody status in a blind fashion. RAYS appears at least equivalent to both ELISA and Western blotting for the monitoring of antibodies against NY-ESO-1 as regards specificity and sensitivity, while antibodies against SSX2 were detected more frequently by RAYS than by ELISA or phage display."}

A universal response to these demands for calcium appears to be the mobilization of maternal skeletal reserves, and bone loss during lactation has been well documented. However, the regulation of calcium and skeletal metabolism during lactation remains enigmatic. Our study was designed to examine mineral and bone metabolism in lactating mice. We found that mice lose bone rapidly at all sites during lactation. Bone mineral density as determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was 20 to 30% lower at the spine, femur, and total body in lactating compared with either age-matched virgin or pregnant mice. The decrease in bone mineral density was accompanied by dramatic reductions in bone volume and changes in trabecular architecture. Bone loss was also accompanied by increases in bone turnover as determined by biochemical markers and histomorphometry. PTHrP levels were elevated during lactation and correlated positively with markers of bone resorption and negatively with bone mass at all sites. Estrogen levels were low during lactation and correlated negatively with bone resorption markers. Finally, estrogen and pamidronate treatment lowered rates of bone resorption to baseline virgin levels and mitigated, but did not prevent, bone loss. These data suggest that the combination of estrogen deficiency and elevations in circulating PTHrP during lactation act to stimulate bone resorption and promote bone loss."}

Powder X-ray diffraction of the vacuum-dried product (without sintering) indicated the presence of an unusual type of orthorhombic crystal structure nearly similar to titanium dioxide crystals prepared at high pressure. On gradual heating up to 900 degrees C these metastable crystals are converted into relatively more stable nanorods perhaps through making and breaking of the Ti-O-Ti bonds. It has been concluded that chemical pressure generated within the constrained volume of aqueous core of the reverse micellar droplets is responsible for the unusual crystal structure of TiO(2) nanoparticles."}

However, it remains unknown whether other co-repressor(s) are also involved with Ski in the negative regulation of the TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathways. Here, we report that the co-repressor homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) directly binds to both c-Ski and Smad1. HIPK2 efficiently inhibited Smad1/4-induced transcription from the Smad site-containing promoter. A dominant negative form of HIPK2, in which the ATP binding motif in the kinase domain and the putative phosphorylation sites were mutated, enhanced Smad1/4-dependent transcription and the BMP-induced expression of alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, the c-Ski-induced inhibition of the Smad1/4-dependent transcription was suppressed by a dominant negative form of HIPK2. The HIPK2 co-repressor activity may be regulated by an uncharacterized HIPK2 kinase. These results indicate that HIPK2, together with c-Ski, plays an important role in the negative regulation of BMP-induced transcriptional activation."}

This method allows simultaneous determination of protease cleavage specificity, molecular weight, isoelectric point, and if necessary, amino acid sequencing. After isoelectric focusing in immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips (pH 6-11) (first dimension), trypsin was electrophoresed in 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels (second dimension) copolymerized with Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA (4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide). The gels were washed in cold 2.5% Triton X-100 and water, and incubated in assay buffer (6.3 mM Bicine, 100 mM NaCl). Trypsin cleavage of the peptide-MCA generated fluorescent 7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin. In 1-D gels, as low as 500 pg trypsin could be detected and trypsin band volumes correlated linearly with the amounts of trypsin (R(2) = 0.999). In 2-D gels, the lowest amount of trypsin detected was 1 ng. The linear regression of spot volume and loading amount was still good (R(2) = 0.974). To optimize renaturation conditions, 5x5 min washes with 2.5% Triton X-100 and water, respectively, gave the strongest band volume. For fluorescence development, an assay buffer at pH 9 was the best; incubation at 37 degrees C for 30 min was sufficient. The method has application for identifying novel proteases as it does not rely on antibodies."}

The thrombin generation test (TGT) was used as a potentially more physiological approach to assess and compare FVIII concentrates. FVIII concentrates were added to artificial FVIII-deficient plasma. Thrombin generation was initiated by the addition of FIXa (14 nm), phospholipid and CaCl2. Thrombin was measured by subsampling into fibrinogen, and curves quantified as area under the curve (AUC) and time taken to half-maximum (t(1/2)max). Addition of one plasma-derived concentrate to as little as 0.005 IU mL-1 gave a normal AUC, but prolonged t(1/2)max. Increasing FVIII to 1 IU mL-1 had little effect on AUC, but did reduce the t(1/2)max to 64 s (normal 114 s). A range of plasma-derived and recombinant concentrates were tested at 1 IU mL-1; results were similar, except the B-domain deleted concentrate, which had the most rapid initial rate of thrombin generation (t(1/2)max 48 s, P < 0.05). Two hemophilic plasmas (< 0.01 IU mL-1) produced large amounts of thrombin (AUC 65% and 69%), although t(1/2)max was prolonged. Addition of a FVIII antibody abolished thrombin generation, indicating that these plasmas contained low levels of FVIII. Decreasing the FIXa concentration (0.2 nm) minimized thrombin generation in hemophilic plasma but not in normal plasma. These results indicate that FVIII < 0.01 IU mL-1 can generate significant quantities of thrombin depending upon the amount of FIXa present. The TGT could prove useful for patient monitoring in gene therapy and prophylaxis."}

The p21WAF1 and p53 gene were transfected respectively into a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, GLC-82. Flow cytometry (FLC), transmission electron microscopy (EM) and TUNEL technique were used to evaluate cell growth and identify apoptosis. The GLC-82 transfected by p21 plasmid showed increased cell number in G1 phase of cell cycle, decreased proliferation potential and decreased cloning efficiency. Apoptosis have not been detected neither on EM nor by TUNEL technique, whereas the GLC-82 infected by Ad-p53 showed significantly decreased proliferation potential and some of them even died, in addition apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL technique. The results indicate that p21WAF1 and p53 can inhibit proliferation; p53 also can induce apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cell. Therefore, these two genes should have a wide application in gene therapy of tumors in future."}

Competition for space or growth factors has been suggested as a mechanism but how these factors themselves are regulated is unclear. We suggest that Tm-cell fratricide by Fas-mediated apoptosis results in a density-dependent death rate that controls the size of the pool without requiring competition for resources or an external quorum-sensing mechanism. A mathematical model based on this concept predicts the known behaviour of the Tm pool, including observed differences in heterogeneity of the CD4 and CD8 compartments and might provide a paradigm for homeostasis of other haematopoietic-cell populations."}

Smoking, alcohol, lung function, body mass index, medical visits and treatments were the independent variables assessed using multivariable logistic regression modelling (OR, 95% CI). A bacterial exacerbation was diagnosed in 39 (43.3%) of 90 patients. Bacterial exacerbations were more prevalent among current smokers (OR 3.77, 95% CI 1.17-12.12), in patients with poor compliance with inhalation therapy (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.18-8.93) and with severe lung function impairment (FEV1 OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-1.00). Prior use of antibiotics was a risk factor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection (OR 6.06, 95% CI 1.29-28.44) and influenza vaccination appeared to have a protective effect against this infection (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.67). We conclude that severe impairment of lung function, smoking and poor compliance with therapy are risk factors for bacterial infection in COPD, and P. aeruginosa should be suspected in patients who have been treated with antibiotics and in those not vaccinated against influenza."}

Tracheal cultures were obtained from both vaccinated and unvaccinated birds within the flock. The cultures were indistinguishable from 6/85 vaccine by both random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and DNA sequence analysis. Challenge studies were performed to compare the field isolates with 6/85 vaccine and the R strain of MG. The field isolates produced a greater antibody response by serum plate agglutination than did the 6/85 vaccine. The isolates effectively colonized the trachea without increasing the tracheal mucosal thickness; however, they did not extensively colonize the air sacs or cause airsacculitis in the experimental birds."}

Three patients were selected for an allergy-characteristic T cell phenotype with high IL-4 expression (AA) or IL-13 expression (AD). Several gene families such as the TGF-beta family, chemokines and chemokine receptors were found to be upregulated.

The patient presented with a relationship problem but there soon emerged a form of compulsive sexuality or hypersexuality in his love relations that became a central feature of the clinical picture. This hypersexuality expressed itself in a compulsive need to stage, or to stage-manage, interpersonal scenaria of a sexual or sexualised nature. These scenaria, which were repeated in different variations and with different personnel, are seen by the author as a dramatisation of the primal scene with the patient taking up the position of the oedipal father. Explanations for the disappearance of male hysteria are given, including a new theory which claims that an imbalance in psychoanalytic theory itself led to the feminisation of hysteria. This critique allows certain forms of hypersexuality in men to be promoted as a form of hysteria, the most common example being Don Juanism-a form of compulsive sexuality that encompasses normative, conversion and character features. The paper also examines the male hysteric's developmental agenda. What the patient's compulsive sexual tableaux exposed was that he had never faced a separation that was not a triangular experience. This meant that his separations were experienced as two developmental agonies telescoped into one-separation (pre-oedipal) and exclusion (early oedipal). This combination, the author suggests, is so frightening in a particular group of men as to explain the choice of hysteria as opposed to some other choice of neurosis."}

Results revealed that low-dose arsenic could block cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and induce apoptosis, whereas DODC could block cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase but not induce apoptosis. However, cells pretreated with DODC showed greater sensitivity to arsenic than untreated cells. The percentage of apoptosis produced by combination treatment with the two agents increased and that was similar to the effect of high-dose arsenic treatment alone. Further studies showed that DODC alone could induce hairpin G-quadruplex formation and inhibit telomerase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Compared with HT1080 cells, 293 cells were more sensitive to cell growth inhibition and apoptosis and were less sensitivity to telomerase activity. These results indicate that DODC can synergistically enhance the apoptosis induced by arsenic, suggesting the increased cell senescence in response to arsenic is induced by an altered telomere state rather than by a loss of telomerase. Thus clinical application of combination treatment with arsenic and telomerase inhibitor may have potential in cancer therapy."}

In rhizobia, essential genes for symbiosis are compartmentalized either in symbiotic plasmids or in chromosomal symbiotic islands. To understand the structure and evolution of the symbiotic genome compartments (SGCs), it is necessary to analyze their common genetic content and organization as well as to study their differences. To date, five SGCs belonging to distinct species of rhizobia have been entirely sequenced. We report the complete sequence of the symbiotic plasmid of Rhizobium etli CFN42, a microsymbiont of beans, and a comparison with other SGC sequences available. The symbiotic plasmid is a circular molecule of 371,255 base-pairs containing 359 coding sequences. Nodulation and nitrogen-fixation genes common to other rhizobia are clustered in a region of 125 kilobases. Numerous sequences related to mobile elements are scattered throughout. In some cases the mobile elements flank blocks of functionally related sequences, thereby suggesting a role in transposition. The plasmid contains 12 reiterated DNA families that are likely to participate in genomic rearrangements. Comparisons between this plasmid and complete rhizobial genomes and symbiotic compartments already sequenced show a general lack of synteny and colinearity, with the exception of some transcriptional units. There are only 20 symbiotic genes that are shared by all SGCs. Our data support the notion that the symbiotic compartments of rhizobia genomes are mosaic structures that have been frequently tailored by recombination, horizontal transfer and transposition."}

Beach-water EC genotypes and ENT phenotypes formed clusters with those from all source types, reflecting diffuse inputs.

Here, we found that heat shock proteins are not induced in male germ cells in response to thermal stress, although heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) is activated. Using HSF1-null mice, we showed that apoptosis of pachytene spermatocytes was markedly inhibited in testes with a single exposure to heat and in the cryptorchid testes, indicating that HSF1 promotes apoptotic cell death of pachytene spermatocytes exposed to thermal stress. In marked contrast, HSF1 acts as a cell-survival factor of more immature germ cells, probably including spermatogonia, in testes exposed to high temperatures. These results demonstrate that HSF1 has two opposite roles in male germ cells independent of the activation of heat shock genes."}

Here we show, both in vitro and in vivo, that GAr also inhibits messenger RNA translation of EBNA1 in cis and that this effect can be distinguished from its effect on proteasomal degradation. Hence, inhibition of messenger RNA translation, but not protein degradation, is essential to prevent antigen presentation on MHC class I molecules. Thus, by minimizing translation of the EBNA1 transcript, cells expressing EBNA1 avoid cytotoxic T cell recognition. At the same time, blocking degradation maintains the EBNA1 expression level."}

The SN-38 formulations were stable in human serum albumin and high lactone concentrations were observed even after 3 h. In vivo studies in nude mice showed prolonged half-life of the active (lactone form) drug in whole blood and increased efficacy compared to Camptosar in a mouse xenograft tumor model."}

Soybean oil triglycerides are rich in linoleic acid, a long chain omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid, which is essential and is an indispensable component of parenteral nutrition. However, very high doses of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids should be avoided, particularly in some critical illnesses. Medium chain triglycerides, long well known to nutritionists and dietitians for their easy intestinal absorption, have become available in parenteral nutrition emulsions in a mixture with soybean oil. Medium chain triglycerides are completely and readily used for energy production and do not interfere significantly in the production of inflammatory mediators, in the composition of cell membranes and in body organ and system functions. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, essential fatty acids derived from fish oil, permeate cell structure and affect cell activity with different mechanisms, playing also an important role in the modulation of inflammatory processes. Omega-3 emulsions in parenteral nutrition are currently added as a supplement to other fat emulsions. Knowledge of these \"non-conventional\" fat emulsions is being continuously improved by investigative work and clinical experience."}

Immunoreactions with antigens to cerebral vessels affected by atherosclerosis in 330 patients with CVD aged 46-82 years with different stages of the disease and various location of CA process was studied. The presence of autoimmune humoral reactions (complement binding reaction, leukocyte lysis reaction, modified erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and cellular reaction (antigene-reactive rosette formation) with antigenes to cerebral vessels affected by atherosclerosis, which intensity significantly prevailed in patients as compared with control groups (healthy young people and people whose age was close to that of patients without symptoms of cerebral atherosclerosis). Statistically significant prevalence of reactions with antigenes to cerebral vessels affected by atherosclerosis intensity above reactions with extracts of intact brain vessels was noted. Intensity of those reactions with antigenes to cerebral vessels affected by atherosclerosis was increased with evolution of CVD and depended on the location of atherosclerotic process: reactions were more pronounced in those arterial territories where the atherosclerotic lesion predominated. High correlation rates of autoimmune reactions with antigenes to cerebral vessels affected by atherosclerosis intensity and some parameters of lipid metabolism (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides), revealed a relationship between the reactions given and hyperlipidemia, which confirms the relationship of cerebral vessels antigenicity to the degree of atherosclerotic lesion."}

In eight healthy volunteers (age range 22-58 years), 28 patients with Parkinson's disease (age range 42-80 years), 10 patients with Parkinsonian syndrome (age range 51-79 years) and 13 patients with essential tremor (age range 43-71 years) were 99mTc-TRODAT-SPECT tests performed. The results were evaluated visually and semiquantitatively. The visual assessments were concordant with those of the semiquantitative in each case. The 99mTc-TRODAT uptake of the striatum was referenced to the cerebellum, the frontal and occipital cortex. The best deviation was found in aspect of the occipital cortex. The striatum/occipital ratio was the following: healthy volunteers: 2.12 +/- 0.27; Parkinson's disease: 1.52 +/- 0.27; Parkinsonian syndrome: 1.57 +/- 0.26; essential tremor: 2.06 +/- 0.69. The striatal dopamine transporter availability was significantly lower in subjects with Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonian syndrome compared to the control subjects. There was no difference between healthy volunteers and patients with essential tremor. Using discriminant analysis, the discriminant function had significantly different values in the group of Parkinson's disease than in Parkinsonian syndrome: f = -3.675 x caud/occipit + 6.293 x put/occipit -2.548. 99mTc-TRODAT-SPECT is able to visualise the presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration. This method itself can be useful in differential diagnosis in some type of movement disorders."}

The intrinsic high affinity GTPase activity of the alpha subunits of G proteins in three signaling systems coupled to adenylyl cyclase, the A(1) adenosine receptor, the muscarinic cholinergic receptor and the beta-adrenergic receptor, was tested at pressures up to 340 atm. Brain membrane preparations from four members of the deep-sea teleost fish family Macrouridae were studied. Coryphaenoides armatus, C. filifer, C. rupestris and Macrourus berglax have depth distributions which together span 100-5810 m. Increased pressure inhibited basal GTPase activity only in M. berglax, which of the four species has the shallowest center of abundance. Increased hydrostatic pressure did not alter the response of GTPase activity to the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Increased pressure decreased the stimulation of GTPase activity by the A(1) adenosine receptor agonist cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) in C. armatus and M. berglax, and by the muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist carbamyl choline in C. armatus, C. filifer and M. berglax. Decreased agonist-stimulation of the GTPase activity at elevated pressure may result from pressure-induced changes in conformational states or inhibition of agonist binding. The binding of the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]) in response to CPA was determined at 5 degrees C and atmospheric pressure. Six macrourid species and a morid were studied. The halftime (t(1/2)) values for GTP[S] binding, ranging from 20.8 to 40.9 min, are similar to values previously reported for two other cold-adapted fishes."}

We have expressed wild-type as well as mutant DFNA5 alleles under control of regulatable nmt1 promoter. Yeast cells tolerated expression of wild-type DFNA5, while expression of the mutant DFNA5 allele, which is responsible for nonsyndromic autosomal dominant hearing impairment, led to cell cycle arrest. We identified new rat and horse DFNA5 homologues and we describe a domain of homology shared between DFNA5 and the Mcm10 family of DNA replication proteins. Genetic interactions between heterologously expressed DFNA5 and a fission yeast cdc23 (mcm10) mutant support a possible link between DFNA5 and Mcm10 proteins."}

A retrospective case study of two patients with idiopathic olfactory hallucination. Records of two patients were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnosis of idiopathic olfactory hallucination was confirmed after excluding any intranasal disease or any central nervous system disorder discernible by an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging. Both patients were successfully treated with sodium valproate. One patient stopped taking sodium valproate because of side effects, only for the symptoms to return, but these were then controlled by phenytoin sodium. The mean patient follow-up time was 3 years 5 months. The symptoms of some cases of idiopathic olfactory hallucination may be controlled by sodium valproate or phenytoin sodium. We hypothesize that this disorder may be a central phenomenon attributable to reverberating circuits."}

We present a case of congenital hepatic fibrosis associated with pulmonary hypertension. A 42-year-old man with congenital hepatic fibrosis visited our hospital with syncope. The man had suffered from breathlessness on exertion for 2 weeks before the episode of syncope. He also had a history of portal hypertension with documented gastric cardiac varices at the age of 28 years. Despite undergoing intensive care, the patient died 1 week after admission owing to severe right-sided heart failure. Autopsy revealed dilatation of the right atrium and right ventricle grossly and plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy microscopically. Accurate diagnosis of portopulmonary hypertension requires awareness of the disease and a high index of suspicion when examining patients with portal hypertension and dyspnea."}

The efficacy of a cholecystocolic bypass in achieving the same goals was investigated in guinea pigs. In the study group (n=7), a cholecystocolic bypass was performed using a jejunal graft interposed between the gallbladder and the cecum. In the control group (n=5), a cholecystojejunal bypass was performed with a similar graft implanted in the proximal jejunum. Total BA concentration was measured in bile and portal blood at surgery (D0) and 30 days later (D30) by pooling the concentrations of 7 individual BA. D30/D0 BA ratios were compared. All animals developed normally without clinical symptoms. A 76% reduction in the bile T-BA levels was observed in both groups (p<0.05). A 80% decrease of T-BA levels was observed in portal vein in study group (p<0.05), suggesting that ileal bile flow and BA ileal reabsorption were highly impaired. No change in portal vein BA levels was observed in control group. Cholecystocolic bypass led to a significant loss of bile acids in guinea pigs and might be considered for bile diversion in pediatric patients with selected cholestatic diseases."}

Then we analyzed the expression pattern of msr/apj in the retinal vessels at various stages of postnatal development by in situ hybridization. In contrast to the expression of ephrin-B2 or EphB4, msr/apj transcripts can be detected as early as postnatal day P3. From P3 to P12, msr/apj expression in the vascular network is restricted to the venules and the associated capillaries. The msr/apj gene is thus an early and specific marker of the venous phenotype in the retinal vasculature."}

I begin with a brief examination of the ways that gender is constructed as natural through the repetition of a set of norms, noting the pervasiveness of these norms and their location at the center of cultural imagination. I then turn to the idea of drag as a practice of subverting these norms through breaking their repetition. I argue that drag king performance, through its failure to approximate the \"natural male,\" draws attention to the very constructedness of the category, and thus of all naturalized categories of gender. Using the budding Edmonton drag king scene as a case example, I discuss some of the ways that drag kings take queer theory and gender deconstruction out of the classroom and into practice. I speculate as to the effectiveness of such practices in the realm of queer theory, pointing to the ways that these performances may be read to reinforce rather than subvert gender norms. I also look at the complexities of \"passing\" gender performances, such as transsexual or transgendered practices, and the ways that these practices align or do not align with performances intending to fail. I propose that the emergence of these practices is in itself a beginning step toward a reevaluation of normative gender, and toward a radical reinvention of new gender possibilities."}

Reporter gene expression studies revealed that in addition, wounding is required for full induction of the gene. Histochemical analysis showed a local beta-glucuronidase induction around the wounding site, especially in veins. In ABA-treated plants, wounding-induced beta-glucuronidase activity could be mimicked by the wound signaling compound methyl jasmonate. In silico studies of the AtMYB102 promoter sequence and its close homolog AtMYB74 demonstrated several conserved putative stress regulatory elements such as an ABA-responsive element, its coupling element 1 (CE1), and a W box. Interestingly, further studies showed that the 5'-untranslated region is essential for the osmotic stress and wounding induced expression of the AtMYB102 gene. This 5'-untranslated region contains putative conserved regulatory elements such as a second W box and an overlapping MYB-binding element. These studies suggest that AtMYB102 expression depends on and integrates signals derived from both wounding and osmotic stress."}

Wild type FTC lack TSH receptors and do not depend on TSH for growth. However, they contain thyroglobulin, have intact thyroid functions and response to TSH. We tested growth, invasion, and adhesion of transfected tumor cells (FTC-TSHr) compared to parental cells. All transfected FTC-TSHr expressed TSHr mRNA. Compared to wild type cells invasion and growth of TSHr-transfected FTC were significantly inhibited (p < 0.001). All FTC adhered best to collagen IV and fibronectin. Compared to parental cells adhesion of unstimulated FTC-TSHr was significantly enhanced (p < 0.001). These in vitro data underline the important role of the human TSH receptor as the main regulator of thyroid growth and functions."}

Therefore, tibial resection referencing the predicted postoperative mechanical axis instead of the tibial shaft axis is advocated. To obtain the optimal tibial resection, characteristics of the tibial proximal deformity were measured radiographically and predicted postoperative lower limb alignment was calculated using full-length, weight-bearing, lower limb anteroposterior radiographs. Two finite element analysis models also were examined. The proximal tibia was resected perpendicular to the tibial shaft axis in model 1, and perpendicular to the predicted postoperative tibial mechanical axis in model 2. When the proximal tibia was resected perpendicular to the tibial shaft axis, the predicted lower limb mechanical axis was significantly shifted medially to the center of the tibial joint surface. The results of the finite element analysis reflected the medial shift of the lower limb mechanical axis in model 1, where stresses were increased in the medial tibial compartment. Tibial resection referencing the predicted postoperative tibial mechanical axis, instead of the tibial shaft axis, should be performed, especially in cases with a deformed tibia."}

Based on these results, the Swedish Quality Board for Carotid Surgery recommends the use of Doppler angle range specific cut off points for the peak systolic velocity in the internal carotid artery for identification of high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis: These cut off points are > or = 2.1 m/s for insonation angles of 0-49 degrees and > or = 3.2 m/s for angles 50-60 degrees.

The excess masking is called informational masking. Though individual differences in the effect are large, the amount of informational masking is typically much greater in young children than in adults [Oh et al., J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 109, 2888-2895 (2001)]. One factor that reduces informational masking in adults is spatial separation of the target tone and masker. The present study was undertaken to determine whether or not a similar effect of spatial separation is observed in children. An extreme case of spatial separation was used in which the target tone was presented to one ear and the random multitone masker to the other ear. This condition resulted in nearly complete elimination of masking in adults. In young children, however, presenting the masker to the nontarget ear typically produced only a slight decrease in overall masking and no change in informational masking. The results for children are interpreted in terms of a model that gives equal weight to the auditory filter outputs from each ear."}

Chronic pain was defined as a continuous or intermittend pain of longer duration than six months. 36% (328 patients) of all investigated patients had chronic pain due to this definition, twice more women than men. The four most frequent localisations of chronic pain were the back, the head, the joints and the legs. 15% of the patients with chronic pain were retired or going to retire due to their chronic pain. Orthopaedics were the most frequent physicians visited in the past. Only 5% of the patients had a psychological therapy and only 1% were treated in a pain clinic. The primary treatment strategies of the chronic pain were physiotherapy and drug therapy. 30% of the patients did not have any pain relieve by the past treatment strategies. Patients with chronic pain are a frequent and important problem in practices of home physicians. The high frequency of patients with chronic pain in practices of specialists demonstrates the necessity of a special qualification also on this level of our medical system."}

The multiple sclerosis and myeloma cast nephropathy trials had data on apheresis use for 3 years prior to and during the trials, which permitted a time-series analysis to determine the impact of the RCTs on the use of apheresis. The ongoing myeloma cast nephropathy trial provided data on the number of patients inside and outside of the RCTs in trial and nontrial centers. Initial and follow-up questionnaires were sent to 24 Canadian physicians in trial and nontrial centers to determine if they had noted an increase in apheresis activity during the trials and, if so, their explanation for it. Change in number of patients undergoing apheresis for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, multiple sclerosis, and myeloma cast nephropathy prior to and during the respective RCTs compared with all patients undergoing apheresis during the same periods. During all 3 RCTs, there were large increases in use of apheresis. The majority of the increased use of apheresis was outside of the trials: for multiple sclerosis, 30 of 49 patients per year (61% of increase); thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 49 of 56 patients per year (72% of increase); and myeloma cast nephropathy, 60 of 72 patients per year (57% of increase). The myeloma cast nephropathy study noted that this increase occurred in both nontrial and trial centers. Among questionnaire respondents (n = 22; 92% response rate), most physicians noted an increase in apheresis activity during the trials and attributed it to a \"jumping-the-gun\" phenomenon. During 3 Canadian RCTs, apheresis increased, but most of the increase occurred outside the trials. This behavior during an RCT, in the absence of clear efficacy, can be termed jumping the gun."}

We found a positive correlation between height and latencies, and a negative association of weight with amplitude of peripheral potential, and age/PNCV. No difference between controls and the neurological intact segments of patients was found. 13 patient had DSEP altered while only 5 of them had altered SEP recorded. The most common finding was prolongation of the conduction time of the segment N9 N13 on DSEP recordings. We found that it is possible to record and to identify all the potentials in DSEP as observed in the SEP. On cervical radiculopathy, DSEP with the present technique increase the sensitivity and give some additional and useful information regarding the extension and localization of the pathology. Besides, DSEP recording is a non invasive technique, non traumatic and well tolerated for our patients."}

Data from a large representative national sample of about 6000 children were analysed using simple and multiple logistic regression. The analysis shows that the prevalence of SDQ scales, such as hyperactivity and conduct disorder were significantly higher in boys, lower social classes and step- and single-parent families. After adjusting for the demographic, socio-economic and family type factors, children who scored borderline or high for hyperactivity were almost two times more likely to report having major accidents. Children who scored high for hyperactivity and emotional symptoms were one and a half times more likely to report having minor accidents. For major accidents involving moving vehicles, the relationships with the behavioural and emotional factors were generally stronger than for major accidents in general. Hyperactivity, in particular, was significantly associated with the occurrence of major and minor accidents, and major accidents involving moving vehicles. The behavioural risk factors were significantly more common in the lower social classes, families receiving benefits and step- and single-parent families."}

The operative mortality was 0.9%. The yearly trend in the number of gallbladder operations performed was generally found to be upward. Significant statistical increases were noted in 1959 and 1960. During the same years significant increases were noted in the proportion of males treated, particularly in the eighth decade of life. As a percentage of total surgical discharges, during 1960, the incidence of gallbladder operations exceeded that of appendectomies, which are being performed less frequently than previously. The peak incidence for gallbladder operations, for both sexes, occurred during the fifth decade of life. These observations suggest that in this hospital population a real increase in the incidence of gallbladder operations has probably occurred. It was not possible to form an opinion regarding possible changes in the clinical aspects of gallbladder disease."}

It has been shown that the two approaches give adequate descriptions of the experimental results. The models were used in order to estimate, respectively the parameter C, which is proportional to the reduction in hydrophobic exposed surface area upon adsorption, and the number of water and salt ions released upon adsorption. It was concluded that the magnitude of these parameters can be strongly influenced by the temperature, the hydrophobicity of the bases of the nucleotides, the molecular mass of the oligonucleotides and the presence of secondary structures. Parameter C was quantitatively related with the number of water molecules and salt ions released upon adsorption. These parameters were found to correlate linearly in cases where structural changes with temperature are not significant."}

Functional and structural vasoconstriction of renal cortical arteries is the earliest change leading to hypertension. In the present study, the interaction of a subpressor dose of angiotensin (Ang) II, a 2% NaCl diet and sympathetic stimulation in the form of overnight cold exposure was investigated in the development of renal structural vascular changes in male Sprague-Dawley rats. 2. Morphometric measurements of renal cortical resistance arteries and volume density measurements of renal cortical components were performed in eight groups of rats after 12 weeks of treatment: AngII; 2% NaCl diet; cold exposure (5 degrees C); AngII plus 2% NaCl diet; AngII plus cold exposure; cold exposure plus 2% NaCl diet; ANG II plus 2% NaCl diet plus cold exposure; and sham operation and treatment (control). 3. The average weekly systolic blood pressure of AngII-treated plus salt-fed rats was increased, whereas that of cold-stressed plus salt-fed rats at room temperature decreased compared with controls. The blood pressure rise of the former group was accompanied by an increased wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR) of cortical resistance arteries and decreased glomerular volume, whereas the reduction in blood pressure in the latter group was accompanied by a decreased WLR of cortical resistance arteries and increased volume density of cortical renal tubules. There were no changes in either the blood pressure or renal structure of the other groups. 4. There is a parallel relationship between changes in preglomerular structural vascular resistance and changes in blood pressure in rats. It remains to be determined whether renal cortical structural changes are the cause of, or are compensatory for, chronic changes in blood pressure."}

The number of new neurons generated under physiological conditions in substantia nigra pars compacta was found to be several orders of magnitude smaller than in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. However, if the rate of neuronal turnover is constant, the entire population of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra could be replaced during the lifespan of a mouse. These data indicate that neurogenesis in the adult brain is more widespread than previously thought and may have implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease."}

When the rat livers are perfused under the conditions of these experiments with rat blood diluted with saline, the livers remain capable of removing colloidal chromic phosphate normally for 4 hours or more; that is, the reticuloendothelial system continues to function normally. 2. Good rates of bile flow continue, generally for 4 hours. 3. The livers incorporate radioactivity from the amino acids methionine, lysine, and histidine at rapid rates for 1 or 2 hours. Thereafter the rates fall. 4. The specific activity of the free lysine and histidine in the perfusate falls rapidly during the experiments (to 25 or 35 per cent of its original value at 10 minutes). 5. The fall in rate of incorporation of radioactivity is attributable to the fall in amino acid specific activity. 6. Addition of a complete amino acid mixture to the perfusate does not appear to have any stimulatory effect on incorporation of radioactivity from labelled amino acids. 7. With lysine, on the assumption that incorporation is due to new protein formation, there is a rate of synthesis equivalent to 230 mg. of plasma protein per 100 gm. of rat per day. This result is in agreement with turnover data obtained from rats in vivo. 8. The results emphasize once again the importance of precursor specific activity in the interpretation of metabolic experiments with labelled amino acids."}

This combines continuum electrostatics and molecular mechanics, deriving equilibrium distributions of ionization states and polar residue and water positions. The three central cluster groups [retinal Schiff base (SB), Asp 85 and Asp 212] are ionized in bR structures while a proton has transferred from SB(+) to Asp 85(-) in late M structures matching experimental results. The proton shift in M is due to weaker SB(+)-ionized acid and more favorable SB(0)-ionized acid interactions following retinal isomerization. The proton release cluster (Glu 194 and Glu 204) binds one proton in bR, which is lost to water by pH 8 in late M. In bR the half-ionized state is stabilized by charge-dipole interactions while full ionization is disallowed by charge-charge repulsion between the closely spaced acids. In M the acids move apart, permitting full ionization. Arg 82 movement connects the proton shifts in the central and proton release clusters. Changes in total charge of the two clusters are coupled by direct long-range interactions. Separate calculations consider continuum or explicit water in internal cavities. The explicit waters and nearby polar residues can reorient to stabilize different charge distributions. Proton release to the low-pH, extracellular side of the protein occurs in these calculations where residue ionization remains at equilibrium with the medium. Thus, the key changes distinguishing the intermediates are indeed trapped in the structures."}

The Coccidia (Sporozoa, Apicomplexa)].", "abstract": "Data on parasitophorous vacuole (PV) formation in host cells (HC) harbouring different intracellular protozoan parasites have been reviewed and critically analysed, with special reference to the main representatives of the Coccidia. The vacuole membrane (PVM) is the interface between host and parasite, playing a role in nutrient acquisition by the parasite from the HC. The PV phenomenon is regarded as a generalized HC response to the introduction of alien bodies (microorganisms), which eventually reflects the evolutionary established host-parasite relationships at cellular, subcellular and molecular levels. Special attention has been paid to the existing morpho-functional diversity of the PVs within the same genera and species of parasites, and even at different stages of the parasite life cycle. The PVM is generally considered to derive from the HC plasmalemma, whose biochemical composition undergoes significant changes as the intravacuolar parasite grows. The original HC proteins are selectively excluded from the PVM, while those of the parasite are incorporated. As the result, the changed PVM becomes not fusigenic for HC lysosomes. For Toxoplasma gondii and other cyst-forming coccidia (Isospora, Sarcocystis), a definite correlation has been noticed between the extent of rhoptry and dense granule secrets released by a zoite during HC internalization, on the one hand, and the pattern of the PV that forms, on the other one. In T. gondii, tachyzoites, known to discharge abundant secrets, commonly force the development of PVs limited with a single unit membrane and equipped with a tubulovesicular network in the lumen. Unlike, bradyzoites known to be deficient in secretory materials trigger the formation of PVs with a three-membrane lining composed of the changed invaginated plasmalemma in addition to two membranes of endoplasmic reticulum. The two different types of PV harbour, respectively, exoenteric and enteric stages of T. gondii, the latter being confined to the cat intestine only. Unlike, all endogenous stages of the classic intestinal coccidia (Eimeria spp.) develop within PVs limited with a single membrane, with some invaginations extending into the PV lumen. Unusual PV patterns are characteristic of the extracytoplasmic eimerian coccidia (Cryptosporidium, Epieimeria) and adeleid haemogreagarines (Karyolysus). In cyst-forming coccidia, the PVM is actively involved in tissue cyst wall formation, thus protecting the encysted parasites from recognition by the host immune system. All this strongly suggests that the PV is far from being an indifferent membraneous vesicle containing a parasite, but represents a metabolically active compartment in infected cells. Since all the coccidia are obligate intracellular parasites, the mode of their intimate interaction with the HC, largely accomplished via the PV and its membrane, is vital for their survival as biological species."}

The strength of NOE transfer correlates with the average distribution of solvent molecules around the corresponding solvation sites represented by the number of solvent molecules in a first solvation sphere, which can be obtained from molecular dynamics simulations in water. Saturation transfer between exchanging protons explains some deviations from this correlation. The NOE transfer measurements provide information on specific solute-solvent interactions and contribute to a better understanding of solvation phenomena. On the basis of a distinct relationship between steric solvation hindrance and the strength of NOE transfer, the application of such measurements for conformational analysis has been demonstrated for the first time."}

Earlier works were focused only on formation of coated buds connected to the initial membrane by narrow membrane necks. We present the theoretical analysis of the whole pathway of budding-fission, including the crucial stage where the membrane neck undergoes fission and the carrier separates from the donor membrane. We consider two successive intermediates of the reaction: 1), a constricted membrane neck coming out of aperture of the assembling protein coat, and 2), hemifission intermediate resulting from self-fusion of the inner monolayer of the neck, while its outer monolayer remains continuous. Transformation of the constricted neck into the hemifission intermediate is driven by the membrane stress produced in the neck by the protein coat. Although apparently similar to hemifusion, the fission is predicted to have an opposite dependence on the monolayer spontaneous curvature. Analysis of the further stages of the process demonstrates that in all practically important cases the hemifission intermediate decays spontaneously into two separate membranes, thereby completing the fission process. We formulate the \"job description\" for fission proteins by calculating the energy they have to deliver and the radii of the protein coat aperture which have to be reached to drive the fission process."}

On the 7th day post-HI the glutathione content was completely recovered in the hippocampus and the striatum, and partially in the cortex. The glutathione loss could not be explained through its conversion to glutathione disulphide or to protein mixed disulphide (S-thiolation), whose values remained constant. Furthermore, we found a consistent decrease (20-30%) in protein thiols, which were not recovered after 7 days post-HI. Perturbations in protein thiols, along with the glutathione loss, may represent a valuable marker of immature rat brain damage."}

In this study, the influences of sex steroids on pituitary responsiveness to SRIF-14 and the pituitary expression of a type two SRIF receptor (sst(2)) were examined. Results from in vitro perifusion of pituitary fragments show that pituitaries from estradiol-primed sexually regressed female fish have significantly lower GH release responsiveness to pulse exposure to SRIF-14 than pituitaries from control or testosterone-treated sexually regressed females. Results from in vitro static culture show that pituitaries from sexually mature female fish have lower GH release responsiveness to SRIF-14 than those from sexually regressed females. In addition, the sst(2) receptor mRNA levels in pituitaries from mature and recrudescent female fish are significantly lower than in sexually regressed female fish. Our results indicate that estradiol acts at the level of the pituitary to regulate GH secretion by influencing the responsiveness to SRIF-14. The underlying mechanism includes, in part, reduction of the expression of sst(2) receptors, presumably leading to the lower number of the receptors available for SRIF binding."}

The second study involved a survey of 3714 students aged 12-17 years, randomly selected from a probability sample of secondary schools in the Australian State of Victoria. In both surveys, adolescents answered questions on their awareness of the advertising campaign and actions taken in response to the campaign. Adolescents in the national evaluation study also answered questions assessing knowledge of health effects of smoking, impact of the campaign on adolescents, and relevance of the campaign for adolescents and other groups. Responses for smokers and nonsmokers were examined. Among the national evaluation sample, 85% of adolescent smokers thought the campaign was relevant to them. Fifty three per cent indicated that the campaign had led some teenagers to at least try to quit and 85% thought it made smoking seem less cool and desirable. Among students who were established smokers the campaign generated quitting activity, with 27% cutting down the number of cigarettes they smoked and 26% having thought about quitting. Results indicate that adolescents were very aware of this adult focused anti-smoking campaign and thought it relevant to them.

Combined treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with AT1 receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been shown to reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) more than monotherapy with either agent. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of chronic dual renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition using non-hypotensive doses of the AT1 receptor antagonist candesartan cilexetil and the ACE inhibitor perindopril on cardiovascular function and structure. 2. Adult male SHR, aged 15 weeks, were divided into four groups: (i) candesartan cilexetil (0.5 mg/kg per day in drinking water); (ii) perindopril (0.3 mg/kg per day in drinking water); (iii) combined treatment (dual RAS inhibition); or (iv) the appropriate vehicle (0.1% ethanol/0.1% polyethylene glycol/1.5 mmol/l sodium bicarbonate dissolved in water for candesartan cilexetil; distilled water for perindopril). Systolic blood pressure was measured weekly using the tail-cuff method and urinary microalbuminuria was measured fortnightly. 3. After 4 weeks, rats were instrumented for intravenous drug administration and measurement of MAP. At this time, the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin (Ang) I and AngII (5-20 ng) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and acetylcholine (ACh; 1-5 micro g) were assessed. In addition, left ventricular : bodyweight and media : lumen ratios were determined as indices of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy, respectively. 4. Candesartan cilexetil and perindopril alone had minimal effect on MAP when measured both directly and indirectly, whereas direct MAP was significantly decreased in the combined treatment group (131 +/- 6 mmHg; P < 0.05) compared with the vehicle group (156 +/- 9 mmHg). Pressor responses to AngI were significantly decreased in all groups compared with the vehicle-treated group and pressor responses to AngII were significantly decreased in the candesartan cilexetil-treated (P < 0.01) and combined treatment groups (P < 0.01) compared with the vehicle-treated group. Depressor responses to ACh and SNP were not significantly affected by any of the antihypertensive therapies compared with vehicle-treated SHR. 5. Vascular hypertrophy was significantly decreased in the candesartan cilexetil and combined groups compared with the vehicle-treated group, whereas cardiac hypertrophy was reduced, with the rank order of effect being: dual RAS inhibition > perindopril > candesartan cilexetil. Urinary albumin tended to decrease with dual RAS inhibition, but was not significantly affected by this short-term treatment. 6. These results demonstrate the efficacy of low-dose dual RAS inhibition as an antihypertensive modality, at least in SHR, not only in reducing arterial pressure, but also in improving cardiovascular structure."}

We investigated whether the ascendancy of computerization, managed care, and the adoption of more businesslike approaches to health care have decreased administrative costs. For the United States and Canada, we calculated the administrative costs of health insurers, employers' health benefit programs, hospitals, practitioners' offices, nursing homes, and home care agencies in 1999. We analyzed published data, surveys of physicians, employment data, and detailed cost reports filed by hospitals, nursing homes, and home care agencies. In calculating the administrative share of health care spending, we excluded retail pharmacy sales and a few other categories for which data on administrative costs were unavailable. We used census surveys to explore trends over time in administrative employment in health care settings. Costs are reported in U.S. dollars. In 1999, health administration costs totaled at least 294.3 billion dollars in the United States, or 1,059 dollars per capita, as compared with 307 dollars per capita in Canada. After exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0 percent of health care expenditures in the United States and 16.7 percent of health care expenditures in Canada. Canada's national health insurance program had overhead of 1.3 percent; the overhead among Canada's private insurers was higher than that in the United States (13.2 percent vs. 11.7 percent). Providers' administrative costs were far lower in Canada. Between 1969 and 1999, the share of the U.S. health care labor force accounted for by administrative workers grew from 18.2 percent to 27.3 percent. In Canada, it grew from 16.0 percent in 1971 to 19.1 percent in 1996. (Both nations' figures exclude insurance-industry personnel.) The gap between U.S. and Canadian spending on health care administration has grown to 752 dollars per capita.

It was adversely affected in the presence of NaOH or HCl at a concentration of 7.5mM and above, and when the ambient temperature was raised above 70 degrees C. All divalent and trivalent metallic chlorides tested at 1.25-10mM including CaCl(2), MgCl(2), ZnCl(2), MnCl(2), and AlCl(3), did not alter the hemagglutinating activity of the lectin. FeCl(3) at 10mM caused the hemagglutinating activity to increase by 100%, but it did not change the lectin activity when tested at lower concentrations up to 5mM."}

The accurate determination of the sound velocity using pulse-echo technique relies on the ability to reduce pulse distortion and to measure specimen dimensions with a high precision. In the field of bio-mimetic materials and biological tissues, the nature of the specimen makes this last requirement highly difficult or inappropriate. The present work, using a through-transmission configuration, allows, in a stress free environment, to access the sound velocity in soft, low acoustic contrast materials without requiring the specimen dimensions. The specimen sound velocity is obtained from the echo time-of-flights through a Z-scan process providing the absolute medium sound velocity as reference. The technique uses an excitation burst at a frequency below the transducer resonance to ensure a significantly reduction in pulse distortions and improve signal-to-noise ratio. The accurate determination of the echo time-of-flight relies on a highly efficient cross-correlation/Hilbert transform signal processing. The method has been applied to gel-based emulsions of different microstructures considered as biomimetic phantoms, as well as to their constituents: pure gelatin and vegetable oil."}

The basic materials and blood samples from 163 southern Chinese were collected. The mutations of exon 6 and exon 7 of hMSH2 gene were investigated by PCR-SSCP, followed by DNA sequencing. Fragments of 250 bp including exon 6 and fragments of 323 bp including exon 7 of hMSH2 gene were amplified by multiple PCR. The allele frequencies of C18, A82 and B39 type mutations were 0.0184, 0.0031, 0.0031, respectively. The gene frequencies and gene type frequencies of three polymorphism sites in normal population accorded with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05). The heterozygosity of C18 type mutation (0.0361) was the highest. There were three polymorphism sites in exon 7 of hMSH2 gene in southern Chinese Han population, among which the genotype frequency of C18 type was the highest, suggesting that C18 type mutation be a useful genetic mark."}

The membrane allows salt and water to pass, but is impermeable to polyelectrolyte molecules. Equilibrium swelling of the capsule is governed by Donnan equilibrium. Transport rates of a salt and water through the membrane are expressed in terms of a Darcy permeability and a salt diffusivity. The governing equations predict that the rate at which equilibrium is attained as the external salt concentration varies is controlled by the timescale for diffusion of salt, rather than by that for Darcy flow. Experiments were performed using capsules with membranes made of covalently linked HSA and alginate. The capsule volume varied with a single relaxation rate when the external salt concentration was changed, as predicted by theory. This constitutes the first step toward a simple method for determining the membrane properties of capsules by measuring rates of change of capsule volume."}

It was suggested that delivering of proteasome inhibitor to the site of vascular injury would be a potential therapeutic approach in prevention of vascular restenosis. But the mechanisms underlying biologic activities of proteasome inhibition in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are largely unknown. We have investigated effects of proteasome inhibition on VSMCs using proteasome inhibitor MG115. MG115 induced apoptotic death in VSMCs as determined by viability, morphology, and DNA fragmentation. Proteasome inhibition was accompanied by up-regulation of p53, p21, and p27. In contrast, there were no appreciable alterations in the levels of Bcl-2 and Bax. Proteasome inhibition was followed by activation of caspase-3 but not of -8. The induction of apoptosis was suppressed by treatment with a selective inhibitor of the caspase-3 family, z-DEVD-fmk but not by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine. These results indicate that proteasome inhibition induces apoptosis in VSMCs by activation of caspase-3."}

Phenethyl alcohol had no effect on the physicochemical properties of isolated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The DNA isolated from phenethyl alcohol-treated bacteria had physicochemical properties identical with those of DNA isolated from normal cells. The metabolic functions most sensitive to the inhibitory action of phenethyl alcohol appeared to be the process of enzyme induction and, possibly, the synthesis of messenger ribonucleic acid.

The material was polymerised in a microwave oven in four different conditions of power and curing time. The kinetics of release of residual monomer in water was evaluated by spectrophotometric method up to 24 h. The hardness of the sample was determined by the Rockwell method and the impact strength tested by the Charpy method. The results were subjected to statistical analysis using ANOVA and Tukey's test for comparison. The levels of residual monomer were found dependent upon the curing conditions and they were correlated with the values of impact strength. Significant differences were observed in this property regarding the analysed conditions (p<0.001). From the appropriate selection of power and time of curing of the resin, it is possible to optimise the level of residual monomer and a low cytotoxicity keeping at the same time the best mechanical properties."}

Total gastrectomy was performed due to gastric ulcer in 1969. She was diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in 1985 and was developed to amyloidosis in 1991. She was started on hemodialysis (HD) for chronic renal failure in 1996. In 1998, her arthralgia was aggravated, and 100 mg/day of bucillamine was administered on the day of HD. Her arthralgia persisted, and switching to salazosulfapyridine (SASP) was considered. As there were no standards and no reports for the use of SASP in HD patients, we examined the pharmacokinetics of SASP and its metabolites, and compared our patient with the results of phase one study in normal subjects in Japan. In this case, the blood concentration of SASP was similar to that in healthy controls after single administration of 500 mg of SASP on the day of non-HD, while the concentration of sulfapyridine (SP) was higher than that in healthy donors. However, the blood concentrations of SASP, SP, and N4-acetyl-SP (AcSP) at 24 hours after administration were similar to those obtained in healthy men. SASP was not dialyzed, while about half of SP and AcSP, were dialyzed. In a five-day consecutive administration study also, the blood concentrations of these compounds on Day 5 were similar to those of phase one study, suggesting no accumulation. No adverse drug reaction was observed. As this case had the past history of total gastrectomy and amyloidosis, it is possible that this result is influenced by the factors. Therefore it is necessary to examine pharmacokinetics of SASP and its metabolites beforehand when administering this agent to other HD/RA patients."}
{"pmid": "12826823", "title": "Role of cardiac power in heart failure.", "abstract": "The heart is a muscular mechanical pump with an ability to generate both flow (cardiac output) and pressure. The product of flow output and systemic arterial pressure is the rate of useful work done, or power output. Cardiac pumping capability can be defined as the cardiac power output (CPO(max)) achieved by the heart during maximal stimulation. Cardiac reserve is the increase in power output as the cardiac performance is increased from the resting to the maximally stimulated state. Recently, several studies have shown that CPO(max), a direct indicator of overall cardiac function, measured directly or as an approximation, is a major determinant of exercise capacity and a most powerful predictor of prognosis for patients with chronic heart failure. The same holds true in acute heart failure, where it is also useful in subclassifying the conditions to select the appropriate treatment."}

All cases were diagnosed incidentally by radiologic and cystoscopic examinations in the evaluation of different conditions, such as hematuria, ovarian abscess, bladder carcinoma, erectile dysfunction, neurogenic bladder, benign prostate hyperplasia and unexplained dysuria. At the beginning, all patients were diagnosed mistakenly as bladder carcinoma. The definitive diagnosis was made after histopathologic examinations of transurethrally resected specimens. Patients were followed for 6 months to 2 years after first diagnosis. No recurrence was established during follow-up. The final urologic examinations which were done currently, were normal. In conclusion, PC is a benign lesion and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder."}

Cranial injection of the PPLO alone in Swiss and Princeton weanlings was attended by a meagre growth of the organisms in the brain, with no pathologic change. The growth of both catarrhal and conjunctival strains of PPLO in the brains of Swiss mice was greatly enhanced by the simultaneous injection of MHV(C). Rolling was not a characteristic sign prior to autopsy. Brain sections regularly showed a vigorous leukocytic response, commonly accompanied by the destruction of nerve cells in the anterior horns of the cerebrum. Injected in Princeton mice together with the virus, the organisms barely survived and were inactive. MHV(Pr) enhanced the growth and pathogenicity of PPLO in the brains of Princeton mice but failed to do so in Swiss. The behavior of PPLO in the brain was likewise affected by the presence of agar, as earlier observed by Findlay et al. In comparison with the effect of MHV, the enhancement was reduced in rate in both strains of mice and was not accompanied by outward signs of nervous disorder. Hydrocephalus which often followed injection of the PPLO-agar mixture was also produced by agar-bouillon alone."}

We have examined the status of gamma-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (gamma-GCS), the rate limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis during recovery of complex I function following L-BOAA toxicity. Sustained and maximal up-regulation of gamma-GCS was seen in motor cortex which was associated with regeneration of complex I activity. In lumbosacral cord, however, the up-regulation was transient and complex I function did not recover.

Fluorescent detection has increasingly replaced colorimetric and radiometric detection on gels and blots. The reasons for this are multiple and varied and include higher sensitivity, better quantitation, increased dynamic range, speed, safety and ease of use. Unlike other methods, fluorescent protein detection is also typically very consistent in response from protein to protein and in many cases is compatible with MS methods for protein identification. The superior sensitivity and benefits achieved by fluorescent techniques have spurred the development of instrumentation capable of delivering precise, sensitive, high-resolution image acquisition over a wide variety of excitation and emission wavelengths. This report focuses on applications using the highly sensitive, charge-coupled device based ProXPRESS multilabel imager, readily configurable for image acquisition over a wide variety of wavelengths (380-700 nm and ultraviolet (UV)) using xenon lamp or UV excitation. The ability to simultaneously detect enzyme activities or protein modifications with different color fluorescent probes in addition to total protein amounts (multiplexing) allows the further mining of proteomic data content from a single set of protein samples. To this end, the development of instrumentation that enables a multiplexing strategy will become central to in-depth proteomic studies. The ProXPRESS maximizes the efficiency of experimental strategies that require flexibility and multicolor fluorescence detection."}

This family is characterized by a unique PX (Phox homology) domain that includes a proline-rich sequence and an upstream phospholipid binding domain. Many sorting nexins, including SNX9, also have a C-terminal coiled region. SNX9 additionally has an N-terminal SH3 (Src homology 3) domain. Here we have investigated the cellular localization of SNX9 and the potential role it plays in insulin action. SNX9 had a cytosolic and punctate distribution, consistent with endosomal and cytosolic localization, in 3T3L1 adipocytes. It was excluded from the nucleus. The SH3 domain was responsible, at least in part, for the membrane localization of SNX9, since expression of an SH3-domain-deleted GFP (green fluorescent protein)-SNX9 fusion protein in HEK293T cells rendered the protein cytosolic. Membrane localization may also be attributed in part to the PX domain, since in vitro phospholipid binding studies demonstrated SNX9 binding to polyphosphoinositides. Insulin induced movement of SNX9 to membrane fractions from the cytosol. A GST (glutathione S-transferase)-SNX9 fusion protein was associated with IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) and insulin receptors in vitro. A GFP-SNX9 fusion protein, overexpressed in 3T3L1 adipocytes, co-immunoprecipitated with insulin receptors. Furthermore, overexpression of this GFP-SNX9 fusion protein in CHOT cells decreased insulin binding, consistent with a role for SNX9 in the trafficking of insulin receptors. Microinjection of 3T3L1 cells with an antibody against SNX9 inhibited stimulation by insulin of GLUT4 translocation. These results support the involvement of SNX9 in insulin action, via an influence on the processing/trafficking of insulin receptors. A secondary role in regulation of the cellular processing, transport and/or subcellular localization of GLUT4 is also suggested."}

Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that GDF-5 deficiency in mice would result in delayed Achilles tendon repair. Using histologic, biochemical, and ultrastructural analyses, we demonstrate that Achilles tendons from 8-week-old male GDF-5 -/- mice exhibit a short-term delay of 1-2 weeks in the healing process compared to phenotypically normal control littermates. Mutant animals took longer to achieve peak cell density, glycosaminoglycan content, and collagen content in the repair tissue, and the time course of changes in collagen fibril size was also delayed. Revascularization was delayed in the mutant mice by 1 week. GDF-5 deficient Achilles tendons also contained significantly more fat within the repair tissue at all time points examined, and was significantly weaker than control tissue at 5 weeks after surgery, but strength differences were no longer detectable by 12-weeks. Together, these data support the hypothesis that GDF-5 may play an important role in modulating tendon repair, and are consistent with previously posited roles for GDF-5 in cell recruitment, migration/adhesion, differentiation, proliferation, and angiogenesis."}

Armadillo-related proteins function in both cell adhesion and signal transduction, and also play a central role in tumorigenesis. Here we report the immunohistochemical localization of PKPs in 37 cases of human primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx lacking overt distant metastases that were followed clinically for 3 years. Immunoreactivity for the PKPs PKP1, PKP2, PKP3, and p0071 (also known as PKP4) was assessed on frozen unfixed sections using a semiquantitative scoring system. Results were correlated with tumor grade, clinicopathologic parameters, and patient survival. Only p0071 was associated with tumor growth, demonstrating an inverse correlation with tumor size. PKP1 and PKP3 immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with tumor histological grade and was observed only in tumors that did not metastasize. In contrast, strong PKP2 immunoreactivity was observed in 85.7% of metastatic tumors. Interestingly, patients with tumors in which PKP1 and PKP3 immunoreactivity was reduced or absent exhibited local recurrences or metastases, or both, as well as poor survival. Correlation of the subcellular localization of PKPs with routine histological and clinical parameters suggests that these proteins may serve as useful markers for predicting the clinical outcome of the disease. Although the 4 PKPs displayed different levels and patterns of subcellular distribution in tumors, there was a positive correlation between immunoreactivity for PKP2 and PKP3, as well as for PKP2 and p0071, suggesting possible functional similarities associated with differentiation, tumor growth, and disease prognosis. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in altering the subcellular localization in tumors compared with normal epithelium are unknown, and further investigation is needed to determine whether PKPs are causative factors for oral carcinogenesis or are merely characteristic of the phenotype."}

An RT-PCR that amplified part of the 3' end of the viral spike (S) gene was devised to distinguish FCoV types I and II. All but 1 of 28 strains of FCoV from 43 cats were type I. Nucleotide identities of the amplified 320 bp product from 49 type I FCoVs ranged from 79 to 100 %. The consensus partial S sequence of isolates recovered from persistently infected cats at time intervals spanning years was generally conserved. While most cats were infected with a single strain, a few may have been infected by more than one strain. Cats that were transiently infected and ceased shedding could be re-infected with either the same, or a different, strain. In most cases, whether a cat became persistently or transiently infected was independent of the virus strain. However, one strain was unusual in that it infected the majority of cats in the household simultaneously and was still being shed 18 months later. Factors that influence whether FCoV establishes lifelong infection in some cats and not others are determined mainly by the host response to infection."}

The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of placing ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibre at five different distances from the tensile side of test samples on flexural properties and the strain energy stored within the dental composite. The results of this investigation showed that whilst moving the fibre reinforcement away from the tensile side by up to 1.5 mm led to a significant reduction in flexural strength, there was no significant decline in the increase in strain energy stored within the tested composite until this distance was exceeded."}

Three hundred and thirty-six African American and Caucasian American women, randomly selected from among urban residents aged 35-47 years and pre-menopausal at baseline, were included in the prospective cohort study. Participants were followed over a 4-year period. Baseline measures included anthropometric variables, socio-demographic factors, measures of anxiety, depressed mood, quality of life, and self-reported measures of diet, vigorous physical activity, alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking. Hormone measurements were obtained during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Weight gain was assessed by comparing the baseline weight with weight measured at the end of the 4-year period. Over 25% of the cohort gained > or =10 lb during follow-up. Five of the 14 women (36%) who were considered menopausal gained weight. Women aged 45-47 were 61% less likely to gain > or =10 lb compared with women aged 35-39 [odds ratio (OR) = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18-0.87]. Depressed mood was a major correlate of weight gain (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.09-3.31). Other psychological measures, including anxiety and quality of life, were similarly correlated with weight gain. No association was detected for levels of sex hormones or self-reported measures of physical activity. Most recalled dietary factors were not predictive of subsequent weight gain in our population. In this population-based sample of women aged 35-47 years, psychological factors were the major predictors of gaining > or =10 lb during a 4-year follow-up period. Few of the other measures, including baseline hormone values, were correlated with subsequent weight gain. These findings suggest that screening for depression and anxiety may be important clinical assessments to identify women at increased risk of substantial weight gain."}

Polyreactive immunoglobulins interact non-specifically with various antigens and this interaction is strongly dependent on an exposure of hydrophobic sites by antigens and, probably, by polyreactive immunoglobulins. Tween 20 and low temperature can substantially suppress this reaction. Various non-related soluble antigens can inhibit the binding of PRIG to any immobilized denatured antigen with similar efficiency. In contrast, natural antibodies interact specifically with appropriate antigens and this interaction can be suppressed only by the same or serologically similar competing antigens. Intact sera contain appreciable amount of polyreactive immunoglobulins, apparently much higher concentration than the concentration of natural antibodies. Biological functions of polyreactive immunoglobulins still remain unknown."}

We have so far identified that the substitution of Leu9 for Arg nullifies the extracellular secretion of HN. Here we comprehensively investigate the amino acid requirement of HN essential for its secretion and for its neuroprotective function. Intracellulary expressed HN-EGFP (EGFP N-terminally fused with HN) was extracellularly secreted, whereas neither EGFP nor (L9R)HN-EGFP was secreted at all. While Ala substitution of neither residue affected HN secretion, Arg substitution revealed that the two structures-Leu9-Leu11 and Pro19-Va120-were essential for the secretion of full-length HN. In the Leu9-Leu11 domain, the Leu10 residue turned out to play a central role in this function, because the Asp substitution of Leu10, but not Leu9 or Leu11, nullified the secretion of HN. Utilizing Ala-scanned HN constructs, we also investigated a comprehensive structure-function relationship for the neuroprotective function of full-length HN, which revealed (i) that Pro3, Ser7, Cys8, Leu9, Leu12, Thr13, Ser14, and Pro19 were essential for this function and (ii) that Ser7 and Leu9 were essential for self-dimerization of HN. These findings indicate that HN has activity similar to a signal peptide, for which the Leu9-Leu11 region, particularly Leu10, functions as a core domain, and suggest that self-dimerization of HN is a process essential for its neuroprotective function."}

We incubated HepG2 cells for 24 h with or without 0.25 mM oleic acid (OA), arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and then compared the expression profiles of thousands of genes using a GeneChip. PUFA influenced the expression of various genes related to cell proliferation, growth and adhesion, as well as for many transcription factors including sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP). Treatments with AA, EPA, and DHA repressed the expression of genes related to cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Moreover, data from gene chip analysis proved that PUPA reduced the expression ofprostasin, which is a serine protease. By measuring the mRNA levels of SREBPs, mevalonate pyrophosphatase and prostasin using quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed the effect of PUFA revealed by gene chip analysis. These data might provide useful clues with which to explore novel functions of PUPA."}

Patients were allocated to a medication and a surgical treatment (following medication) group. We initially examined the International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS), uroflow rate, prostate volume, postvoid residual volume, and the serum prostate specific antigen level as clinical baseline factors and analyzed differences between the two groups. 337 patients (77.1%) were given maintenance medical treatment during follow-up, and 100 patients (22.9%) had surgical treatment following medication. Statistically significant differences were found in IPSS and prostate volume between the surgical and medication groups (IPSS: 22.6+/-6.4 vs. 18.7+/-5.8, prostate volume (cm(3)): 36.3+/-14.4 vs. 30.1+/-11.0, respectively). According to the ROC curve-based prediction of the failure for medical therapy, the best cutoff values of IPSS and prostate volume were 21 (area under ROC curve: 0.67) and 32cm(3) (area under ROC curve: 0.65), respectively. The results show that BPH patients with more severe IPSS and larger prostate volume have a higher risk of medical treatment failure, and suggest that the IPSS and prostate volume may be useful predictors of medical treatment maintenance."}

We have identified seven BBI genes from japonica rice (Oryza sativa subsp. japonica var Teqing). All of the genes identified were found in a single cluster on the southern end of the long arm of rice chromosome 1. Four of the seven BBI genes have two repetitive cysteine-rich domains, whereas one has a truncated domain with only one reactive site. We have also identified three novel BBI genes, each of which possesses three repetitive domains instead of two. In situ hybridization analyses indicated that the accumulation of rice BBI transcripts was differentially regulated in germinating embryos and also in the leaves, roots, and flower organs at later developmental stages. Different members of the rice BBI gene family displayed different expression patterns during rice seed germination, and wounding induced the expression of rice BBI transcripts. The three-domain BBIs had higher expression levels than the two-domain BBIs. It was also found that the mRNA of rice BBI genes was present in abundant amounts in scutellar epithelium and aleurone layer cells. RBBI3-1, one of the three-domain RBBI, exhibited in vitro trypsin-inhibiting activity but no chymotrypsin-inhibiting activity. Overexpression of RBBI2-3 in transgenic rice plants resulted in resistance to the fungal pathogen Pyricularia oryzae, indicating that proteinase inhibitors confer resistance against the fungal pathogen in vivo and that they might play a role in the defense system of the rice plant."}

Blue-yellow (S versus L+M cone) opponency is mediated by a growing family of low-density ganglion types that receive either excitatory or inhibitory input from S cones. Thus, the retinal circuits that underlie colour signalling in primates may be both more complex and more diverse then previously appreciated."}

Results demonstrated that both neurons and astrocytes expressed specific RNA for CD137 and its protein, which was found both on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, microglia, which also expressed CD137 mRNA, showed negative immunostaining. CD137-L-specific RNA was detected only in astrocytes and neurons. When brain cells were treated with fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), upregulation of CD137 but not of its ligand was observed in neurons and astrocytes. Protein localization was also affected. In microglia, an inhibition of RNA expression was induced by treatment, whereas CD137-L remained negative. Our data are the first demonstration that human brain cells express a protein found thus far in activated immunocompetent cells and epithelia. Moreover, they suggest not only that CD137 and CD137-L might play a role in interaction among human brain cells, but also that FGF-2 might have an immunoregulatory function in brain, modulating interaction of the central nervous system with peripheral immunocompetent cells."}

In this study, we demonstrate that CtBP1 was SUMOylated and that its SUMOylation profoundly affected its subcellular localization. SUMOylation occurred at a single Lys residue, Lys428, of CtBP1. CtBP2, a close homolog of CtBP1, lacked the SUMOylation site and was not modified by SUMO-1. Mutation of Lys428 into Arg (K428R) shifted CtBP1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, while it had little effect on its interaction with the PxDLS motif. Consistent with a change in localization, the K428R mutation abolished the ability of CtBP1 to repress the E-cadherin promoter activity. Notably, SUMOylation of CtBP1 was inhibited by the PDZ domain of nNOS, correlating with the known inhibitory effect of nNOS on the nuclear accumulation of CtBP1. This study identifies SUMOylation as a regulatory mechanism underlying CtBP1-dependent transcriptional repression."}

Some aspects of non-infectious virus production.", "abstract": "Certain aspects of the formation of non-infectious hemagglutinins (NIHA) in the chick embryo infected with influenza virus have been analyzed. It was shown by the use of combined in ovo-deembryonation technics that little or no NIHA is released following infection with small doses of standard virus during the most active and constant growth periods of the virus extending to about the 36th hour of incubation in spite of the fact that multiple infection of cells must have taken place in the latter half of that period. A slight decrease in the ID(50)/HA ratios of the yields obtained after the 36th hour, coinciding with the falling off of virus production and release may possibly be explained in terms of inactivation of completed virus or leakage of as yet incompleted virus from damaged cells. Exposure of the entodermal cells of the allantois of eggs deembryonated shortiy after injection of saturation or near saturation inocula of standard seed to large quantities of infectious virus added to the media at various times after infection and not extending over more than 2 hours resulted in a decrease of the ID(50)/HA ratios of the progenies only during the first 2 or possibly 4 hours after the primary inoculation. Later addition did not influence the yields. As discussed, such sudden and heavy exposures of cells are not expected to occur during the infectious process induced by small inocula of standard seed. The possible role of destruction of cell receptors in NIHA production has been analyzed in several ways. The addition of receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) to the media of deembryonated eggs after near saturation inocula of standard seeds, if anything, increased the ID(50)/HA ratios of the progenies, and that only when added during the first few hours following infection, presumably by reducing the changes for high multiplicity of infection of cells. In contrast, ultraviolet-inactivated virus, which retains its enzymatic activity, lowered, if anything, the ID(50)/HA ratios of the progenies, when present in the media of deembryonated eggs from the 2nd to 4th or possibly 6th hour after infection. Excessive amounts of irradiated virus may still cause some degree of interference under these conditions. Later addition of irradiated viruses were without effect with respect to NIHA production or interference. In attempts to alter the cell receptors prior to infection by potassium periodate (KIO(4)), it was noted that the addition of glycerol led to the appearance and partial retention for at least 24 hours of substances in the allantoic fluids which were capable of inactivating considerable proportions of standard virus. These data indicate that destruction of external cell receptors plays little if any role in NIHA production. The implications of these findings are discussed."}

Patients with an indication for elective external CV were enrolled. After successful CV, PSAECGs were recorded at 0.5, 1, 24 h and 1 week. The ability of PSAECG parameters (signal-averaged P wave duration, PWD; root-mean-square of the voltage of the terminal 20, 30, and 40 ms of the signal-averaged P wave; RMS20, RMS30, RMS40) to predict ERAF (prospectively defined as AF recurrence within 4 h after CV) was assessed. Of 111 consecutive patients, 7 experienced ERAF, 30 patients had AF recurrence later during the 1-week follow-up. Patients with ERAF had a significantly prolonged signal-averaged PWD compared to patients who remained in SR (194+/-16 ms vs 139+/-3 ms at 0.5 h, p<0.001). As ROC analysis revealed, a PWD >/=154 ms at 30 min after CV had the highest predictive accuracy for ERAF (sensitivity 100%, specificity 82%, positive predictive value 33%, negative predictive value 100%). Other parameters of the PSAECG did not reveal significant differences between patients with and without ERAF. The PSAECG provides a sensitive noninvasive tool for detection of patients at risk of ERAF. Thus identified, tailored pharmacological therapy is conceivable to prevent ERAF."}

Stainless steel brackets were bonded in each test group with composite resin. After bonding, all samples were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hours and then tested for shear bond strength. Noncontaminated enamel surfaces had the highest bond strengths for conventional, hydrophilic, and self-etching primers, which produced the same strength values. In most contaminated conditions, the self-etching primer had higher strength values than either the hydrophilic or conventional primers. The self-etching primer was the least influenced by water and saliva contamination, except when moistening occurred after the recommended 3-second air burst. No significant differences in debond locations were found among the groups bonded with the self-etching primer under the various enamel conditions."}

Subjects were randomised into either an exercise intervention group or a control group. Physical performance and general health measures were assessed at baseline and repeated 6-months into the trial. Falls were measured over a 12-month follow-up period using monthly postal surveys. at baseline both groups were well matched in their physical performance, health and activity levels. The intervention subjects attended a median of 23 exercise classes over the year, and most undertook the home exercise sessions at least weekly. At retest, the exercise group performed significantly better than the controls in three of six balance measures; postural sway on the floor with eyes open and eyes closed and coordinated stability. The groups did not differ at retest in measures of strength, reaction time and walking speed or on Short-Form 36, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly or fear of falling scales. Within the 12-month trial period, the rate of falls in the intervention group was 40% lower than that of the control group (IRR=0.60, 95% CI 0.36-0.99). these findings indicate that participation in a weekly group exercise programme with ancillary home exercises can improve balance and reduce the rate of falling in at-risk community dwelling older people."}

Postmenopausal women (N = 14) completed a study in which they consumed an alcohol treatment daily for 8 weeks. In a three-period crossover design, women consumed 0, 15 or 30 g/day ethanol, with each subject completing each treatment level. Following the 8-week adaptation period, the subjects consumed a single dose of 15 g ethanol, and breath samples collected to assess breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) every 5 minutes until the BrAC declined to zero. Adaptation to daily alcohol intake of 30 g/day resulted in reduced breath alcohol response compared to adaptation to 0 g/day. Specifically, area under the BrAC time curve was lower after women had consumed 30 g ethanol per day compared to that after daily consumption of 0 grams per day. Also, the time required for BrAC to decline to 0.01% after the bolus dose was reduced when subjects were adapted to 30g/day compared to 0 g/day. Daily intake of alcohol at a level of 30 g/day appears to be sufficient to alter the parameters related to systemic alcohol exposure."}

After cisplatin treatment, A2780-MDM2 cells showed a pronounced S-phase arrest; however, A2780 cells with intact wild-type p53 arrested primarily in G2/M phase. MDM2 overexpression can increase cisplatin cytotoxicity in A2780, with loss of G1/S checkpoint control and decreased cisplatin-DNA adduct repair.

Laser treatment was initiated 24 h after the trauma and continued daily for 7 or 14 days in two groups of nine rats (n=3 per laser dose and period). Two control groups (n=9 each) with injured tibiae were used. The course of healing was monitored using morphometrical analysis of the trabecular area. The organization of collagen fibers in the bone matrix and the histology of the tissue were evaluated using Picrosirius-polarization method and Masson's trichrome. After 7 days, there was a significant increase in the area of neoformed trabeculae in tibiae irradiated with 0.3 and 0.9 J compared to the controls. At a daily dose of 0.9 J (15 min of irradiation per day) the 7-day group showed a significant increase in trabecular bone growth compared to the 14-day group. However, the laser irradiation at the daily dose of 0.3 J produced no significant decrease in the trabecular area of the 14-day group compared to the 7-day group, but there was significant increase in the trabecular area of the 15-day controls compared to the 8-day controls. Irradiation increased the number of hypertrophic osteoclasts compared to non-irradiated injured tibiae (controls) on days 8 and 15. The Picrosirius-polarization method revealed bands of parallel collagen fibers (parallel-fibered bone) at the repair site of 14-day-irradiated tibiae, regardless of the dose. This organization improved when compared to 7-day-irradiated tibiae and control tibiae. These results show that low-level laser therapy stimulated the growth of the trabecular area and the concomitant invasion of osteoclasts during the first week, and hastened the organization of matrix collagen (parallel alignment of the fibers) in a second phase not seen in control, non-irradiated tibiae at the same period. The active osteoclasts that invaded the regenerating site were probably responsible for the decrease in trabecular area by the fourteenth day of irradiation."}

We used individual motion signals that were below detection threshold, implicating spatiotopic trans-saccadic integration in relatively early stages of visual processing such as the middle temporal area (MT) or V5 of visual cortex. The trans-saccadic buildup of important congruent visual information while irrelevant non-congruent information fades could provide a simple and robust strategy to stabilize perception during eye movements."}

This suggests that the femtosecond oscillations in RC kinetics with 32 cm(-1) frequency may be caused by rotation of hydrogen-containing groups, in particular the water molecule which may be placed between primary electron donor P(B) and primary electron acceptor B(A). This rotation may appear also as high harmonics up to sixth in the stimulated emission of P*. The rotation of the water molecule may modulate electron transfer from P* to B(A). The results allow for tracing of the possible pathway of electron transfer from P* to B(A) along a chain consisting of polar atoms according to the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (1PRC): Mg(P(B))-N-C-N(His M200)-HOH-O = B(A). We assume that the role of 32-cm(-1) modulation in electron transfer along this chain consist of a fixation of electron density at B(A)(-) during a reversible electron transfer, when populations of P* and P(+)B(A)(-) states are approximately equal."}

Our goal was to investigate whether designing coiled-coils with identical hydrophobicity but with different hydrophobic clustering of non-polar core residues (each contained 6 Leu, 3 Ile, and 7 Ala residues in the hydrophobic core) would affect helical content and protein stability. The disulfide-bridged P3 and P2 differed dramatically in alpha-helical structure in benign conditions. P3 with three hydrophobic clusters was 98% alpha-helical, whereas P2 was only 65% alpha-helical. The stability profiles of these two analogs were compared, and the enthalpy and heat capacity changes upon denaturation were determined by measuring the temperature dependence by circular dichroism spectroscopy and confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that P3 assembled into a stable alpha-helical two-stranded coiled-coil and exhibited a native protein-like cooperative two-state transition in thermal melting, chemical denaturation, and calorimetry experiments. Although both peptides have identical inherent hydrophobicity (the hydrophobic burial of identical non-polar residues in equivalent heptad coiled-coil positions), we found that the context dependence of an additional hydrophobic cluster dramatically increased stability of P3 (Delta Tm approximately equal to 18 degrees C and Delta[urea](1/2) approximately equal to 1.5 M) as compared with P2. These results suggested that hydrophobic clustering significantly stabilized the coiled-coil structure and may explain how long fibrous proteins like tropomyosin maintain chain integrity while accommodating polar or charged residues in regions of the protein hydrophobic core."}

However, we find that removing antennae and maxillae (AM) from Manduca sexta and Diacrisia virginica larvae has little effect on amounts eaten, patterns of feeding, and the microstructure (each bite and pause) of feeding, as quickly as two days after the operation. However, there was a small change in the microstructure of feeding of AM D. virginica. Bite frequency of AM D. virginica was significantly lower than for controls when larvae began meals without exploring the food first. Exploring was also followed by longer chewing bouts. Acute effects of the ablation were tested using only Manduca. Six hours after the operation larvae ate less than most controls by eating fewer meals and by biting more slowly. Unilateral ablates also ate less 6h post-operatively, by eating fewer meals; their bite frequency was not low. These observations suggest that chemosensory input affects bite frequency but not other aspects of feeding. As quickly as 24h post-operatively other sensory input to the CNS of AM larvae may compensate for the reduction in chemosensory information, but overall, chemosensory input appears relatively unimportant in non-choice situations."}

Overexpression of eIF4E results in the upregulation of specific angiogenic factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The study aims to demonstrate that the overexpression of eIF4E could facilitate recognizing initiation start sites for the translation of bFGF and play an important role in the tumorigenesis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Retrospective. Paraffin-embedded sections of 37 samples of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, 10 samples of vocal cords polyps, and 20 fresh samples of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed using immunohistochemical streptavidin peroxidase technique, Western blot analysis, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The overexpression of eIF4E was observed in all 37 paraffin-embedded samples of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, whereas no staining was noticed in vocal cords polyps samples. There were significant correlations between the overexpression of protein eIF4E and TN stages, histological grades, local recurrence, and the states of metastasis (P <.01). Moreover, the overexpressions of both bFGF protein and bFGF messenger RNA correlated with the histological grades and the states of metastasis (P <.01), but the overexpression of eIF4E and bFGF did not correlate with age, sex, and tumor sites (P >.05). Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E can enhance the expression of bFGF at translation level. The eIF4E and bFGF collaborate in tumorigenesis, development, invasion, and metastasis of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, in view of which the former can be considered as a tumor molecular marker and an independent prognostic molecular marker of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma."}

For patients in the LDR group (n = 341), the treatment sources consisted of Ir-192 pin for 227 patients (1973-1996; irradiated dose, 61-85 Gy; median, 70 Gy), Ra-226 needle for 113 patients (1967-1986; 55-93 Gy; median, 70 Gy). Ra-226 and Ir-192 were combined for one patient. Ir-192 HDR (microSelectron-HDR) was used for 58 patients in the HDR group (1991-present; 48-60 Gy; median, 60 Gy). LDR implantations were performed via oral and HDR via a submental/submandibular approach. The dose rates at the reference point for the LDR group were 0.30 to 0.8 Gy/h, and for the HDR group 1.0 to 3.4 Gy/min. The patients in the HDR group received a total dose of 48-60 Gy (8-10 fractions) during one week. Two fractions were administered per day (at least a 6-h interval). The 3- and 5-year local control rates for patients in the LDR group were 85% and 80%, respectively, and those in the HDR group were both 84%. HDR brachytherapy showed the same lymph-node control rate as did LDR brachytherapy (67% at 5 years). HDR brachytherapy achieved the same locoregional result as did LDR brachytherapy. A converting factor of 0.86 is applicable for HDR in the treatment of early oral tongue cancer."}

Subjects performed a series of 15 9-metre walks along a level floor under uncued and four cued conditions; the order of cued conditions was randomized. A physiotherapy gymnasium, Manchester, UK. Eleven subjects with early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Preferred pace was established from the initial three uncued walks. The rate of auditory cues delivered throughout subsequent walks was systematically adjusted for each subject, representing 85, 92.5, 107.5 and 115% of their mean cadence at preferred walking pace. Mean cadence, mean stride length and mean velocity. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated that the mean velocity and mean cadence of subjects' gait significantly (p < or = 0.01) increased relative to baseline values at cue rates of 115 and 107.5% of cadence at preferred pace and decreased at cue rate of 85%. Mean stride length was unaffected by variations in cue rate. The rate of auditory cues, within the range tested, can modulate cadence and thus velocity of gait of subjects with early-stage Parkinson's disease. The provision of auditory cues provides a potential strategy for enhancing walking performance in these patients."}

A database of cytologic specimens from EUS-FNA was reviewed to identify all hepatic lesions aspirated between January, 1997, and July, 2002. Procedural indications, prior radiographic data, patient demographics, EUS examination results, complications, and follow-up data were obtained and recorded. EUS-FNA of 77 liver lesions in 77 patients was performed without complications. Of these 77 lesions, 45 (58%) were diagnostic for malignancy, 25 (33%) were benign, and seven (9%) were nondiagnostic. A total of 22 lesions were confirmed as negative for malignancy by follow-up (mean 762 days, range 512-1556 days) or intraoperative examination; however, seven lesions could not be classified as benign or malignant. Depending on the status of the seven unclassified lesions, sensitivity of EUS-FNA for the diagnosis of malignancy ranged from 82 to 94%. When compared with benign lesions, EUS features predictive of malignant hepatic masses were the presence of regular outer margins (60% vs 27%; p = 0.02) and the detection of two or more lesions (38% vs 9%; p = 0.03). Of the 42 patients with malignancy identified by EUS-FNA and other available imaging records, EUS detected the malignancy in 41% of patients with previously negative examinations. For the 45 subjects with cytology positive for malignancy, EUS-FNA changed management in 86% of subjects. EUS-FNA of the liver is a safe and sensitive procedure that can have a significant impact on patient management. Prospective studies comparing the accuracy and complication rate of EUS-FNA and percutaneous fine needle aspiration (P-FNA) for the diagnosis of liver tumors are needed."}

Ten of 15 strains of B. subtilis and four of six strains of B. licheniformis were able to cause rope spoilage of the laboratory-baked bread. RAPD typing can be useful in the tracking of Bacillus strains during bakery processing and in the understanding of the role of different Bacillus strains in the rope spoilage of bread. The results indicate the variability of Bacillus strains isolated from flour and responsible for rope spoilage of bread."}

PXR is activated by a broad spectrum of lipophilic xenobiotics including prescription drugs, herbs, pesticides, endocrine disruptors and other environmental contaminants. The promiscuous ligand-binding properties of PXR are facilitated by the large volume and smooth shape of its ligand-binding pocket. PXR binds to DNA as a heterodimer with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and regulates a large number of genes involved in the detoxification and excretion of toxic substances. Although PXR evolved to protect the body, its activation by various prescription drugs and herbs such as St. John's wort represents the molecular basis for an important class of drug-drug interactions. Assays that detect PXR activation can now be used to predict and prevent these drug-drug interactions."}

We identified a 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) and a ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxlase/oxygenase (RuBisCO, E.C.4.1.1.39) gene that encode the form I large subunit ( cbbL) from symbiont-bearing tissue of the pogonophoran Oligobrachia mashikoi. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence suggested that the pogonophoran endosymbiont belonged to the gamma-subdivision of Proteobacteria. The endosymbiont was most closely related to an uncultured bacterium from a hydrocarbon seep, forming a unique clade adjacent to the known methanotrophic 16S rDNA cluster. The RuBisCO gene from the pogonophoran tissue was closely related to those of the chemoautotrophic genera Thiobacillus and Hydrogenovibrio. Presence of the RuBisCO gene suggested a methanotrophic symbiosis because some methanotrophic bacteria are known to be capable of autotrophy via the Calvin cycle. In contrast, particulate and soluble methane monooxygenase genes ( pmoA and mmoX) and the methanol dehydrogenase gene ( mxaF), which are indicators for methanotrophs or methylotrophs, were not detected by repeated trial of polymerase chain reaction. For 16S rRNA and RuBisCO genes, endosymbiotic localizations were confirmed by in situ hybridization. These results support the possibilities that the pogonophoran host has a novel endosymbiont which belongs to the gamma-subdivision of Proteobacteria, and that the endosymbiont has the gene of the autotrophic enzyme RuBisCO."}

The need for a therapeutic range with the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) has not been validated in patients with arterial thrombosis who receive heparin. Therefore, it is unclear whether there is an association between recurrent CV events and low APTT values and between bleeding and high APTT values. We examined the relationship between the APTT and recurrent cardiovascular events and bleeding among 5058 patients with an acute coronary syndrome without ST elevation who received intravenous heparin in the OASIS-2 trial. The increase in relative risk of recurrent CV events was 1.54 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.15; P=0.01) among patients with APTT values <60 seconds compared with patients with APTT values > or =60 seconds. When patients had persistently subtherapeutic APTT values for more than 48 hours, the increase in relative risk of a recurrent CV event was 1.84 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.70). Higher APTT values were associated with bleeding; for every 10-second increase in the APTT, the probability of major bleeding was increased by 7% (95% CI 3% to 11%; P=0.0004). In patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST elevation who are treated with intravenous heparin, our findings justify regular APTT monitoring to minimize recurrent ischemic events and bleeding."}

In the present paper it is demonstrated that tumor angiogenesis factors impair leukocyte rolling and adhesion under flow conditions. Three lines of evidence presented in this paper support this finding; (i) treatment of cultured endothelial cells (EC) with the angiogenic factor basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) results in decreased ICAM-1 expression and decreased numbers of adhering leukocytes under flow conditions. (ii) flow induced upregulation of endothelial ICAM-1 in the presence of bFGF does not yield ICAM-1 levels higher than on resting EC. (iii) bFGF decreases the TNFalpha mediated induction of E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression, resulting in decreased rolling and firm adhesion of leukocytes on the endothelial surface. For ICAM-1 it is demonstrated that bFGF inhibits TNFalpha induced levels of mRNA, and that this effects is transcriptionally regulated. These findings support our earlier described hypothesis that angiogenic factors are involved in the tumor derived escape mechanism from immune surveillance, since we demonstrate here that these mechanisms are operative under physiologic flow conditions."}

Among these subjects, first and second phase insulin responses (1stIR and 2ndIR) were measured in 60 subjects. The I27L genotypes were determined from genomic DNA. We also reviewed the published peptide sequence data on this polymorphism. The estimated beta cell indices correlated well with the measured indices. Although the impact of this polymorphism was noted in the measured indices (P<0.01 for 1stIR and P=0.04 for 2ndIR) from 60 subjects, the differences in the estimated indices were only noted in the extended sample set with 78 subjects (P=0.05 for 1stPH(S) and P=0.04 for 2ndPH(S)). This polymorphism occurs in the dimerization domain, which is completely conserved within human, rat, mouse and hamster. This amino acid is also conserved in chicken and zebrafish, but not in the frog. This conservation suggests a possible biological importance of this amino acid. By increasing the sample size, we demonstrated the role of the I27L polymorphism in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes by using estimated beta cell indices.

Flow demand was estimated from mean inspiratory flow on continuous positive airway pressure. Mechanical load on upper airway muscles was estimated from minimal effective continuous positive airway pressure, flow demand, and minimum flow observed during brief pressure dial downs. Compensatory effectiveness was estimated by relating polysomnographic severity and mechanical load. Mechanical load was more severe in men, in supine position, and in older and heavier patients. Higher flow demand contributed significantly to mechanical load in men and in those who are obese. At the same mechanical load, severity was independent of age, sex, or body mass index but was greater in the supine position and in REM sleep. Mechanical load accounted for only 34% of variability in severity. Eighty-two percent of patients experienced periods of stable breathing despite mechanical loads that would produce continuous cycling without compensation. I conclude that most patients can adequately compensate for the abnormal mechanics, at least part of the time. Higher flow demand contributes to severity in men and in obesity. Severity is largely due to factors other than mechanical load. Compensatory effectiveness is impaired in the supine position and in REM sleep, but not by age, sex, or body mass index."}

In algorithmic form, tracking allows experimentalists to examine many of the unstable states responsible for much of the observed nonlinear dynamic phenomena. Here we present a theoretical foundation for tracking controlled states from both dynamical systems as well as control theoretic viewpoints. The theory is constructive and shows explicitly how to track a curve of unstable states as a parameter is changed. Applications of the theory to various forms of control currently used in dynamical system experiments are discussed. Examples from both numerical and physical experiments are given to illustrate the wide range of tracking applications. (c) 1997 American Institute of Physics."}

It is currently believed that persistent infection occurs in 25-50% of infected individuals, however, it still remains an \"orphan\" virus in search of a role in human pathology. Molecular epidemiological studies have demonstrated that GBV-C infection is present in about 1-1.4% of the healthy population in developed countries, that it shares routes of transmission with HIV and HCV and that the prevalence of GBV-C in these populations is higher than in blood donors. On the basis of the sequence variation among the isolates, GBV-C is classified into at least four major genotypes. Preliminary evidence has suggested that GBV-C is a lymphotropic virus that replicates mainly in the spleen and bone marrow. Recently, several reports have investigated the possible beneficial effect of GBV-C co-infection on HIV disease progression to AIDS, reduced mortality in HIV infected individuals and lower HIV viral loads, not leading to a definitive conclusion yet. To investigate the role of GBV virus C co-infection in two different subsets of HIV-infected patients, and to evaluate the prevalence of GBV-C genotypes in Northern Italy. A total of 86 HIV positive patients were examined for GBV-C viremia (years after HIV sera conversion: 12 +/- 5). Control population (Group A): 46 patients (mean age 42 years) with <200CD4/ml during the observation period. Longterm non progressor population (Group B): 40 patients, (mean age 40 years) with >500 CD4/ml for at least 8 years and never treated with HAART. After extraction of viral RNA from plasma samples, amplification of a highly conserved region of 5'UTR was performed by nested RT-PCR. All positive samples were genotyped by sequencing, alignment with published sequences and phylogenetic analysis. CD4 cell count, HIV plasma levels were also evaluated. 9 out of 46 (19.56%) in Group A and 15 out of 40 (37.5%) in Group B had detectable GBV-C viremia (p=0.064, OR 2.47, percent confidence interval 0.94 to 6.51). No statistical difference was observed when disease stage was evaluated between the two groups. In Group B, after regression analysis for CD4 cell count decrease over the period observed, no significant difference was detected between GBV-C positive and negative patients. No significant difference was observed in Group B in HIV viremia and CD4 cell count at time of GBV-C detection between GBV-C infected patients and GBV-C negative patients. All Italian patients were genotype 2, the only African patient carried GBV-C genotype 1. Although previous results suggest that GBV-C virus may be a favorable marker for long term non progression of HIV disease, whether it plays a direct anti-HIV role or just takes advantage of non progessors' higher CD4 cell count to replicate more efficiently, still remains to be answered. Follow up of untreated patients and further evaluation of virological interactions, between the viruses and the host immune system, will be helpful to shed some light on these observations, offering new prognostic and eventually therapeutical tools for the management of HIV patients."}

Thus, precise control of DGK activity is essential for proper signal transduction. We demonstrated previously that a peptide corresponding to the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) phosphorylation site domain (PSD) in DGK zeta was phosphorylated in vitro by an active fragment of protein kinase C (PKC). In the present study, we tested full-length DGK zeta and found that PKC alpha phosphorylated DGK zeta on serines within the MARCKS PSD in vitro and in vivo. DGK zeta also coimmunoprecipitated with PKC alpha, suggesting that they reside in a regulated signaling complex. We then tested whether phosphorylation affected DAG kinase activity. We found that a mutant (DGK zeta S/D) in which serines within the MARCKS PSD were altered to aspartates (to mimic phosphorylation) had lower activity compared with wild-type DGK zeta or a control mutant (DGK zeta S/N) in which the same serines were changed to asparagines. Furthermore, activation of PKC alpha by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate inhibited the activity of wild-type DGK zeta, but not DGK zeta S/D, in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. These results suggest that by phosphorylating the MARCKS PSD, PKC alpha attenuates DGK zeta activity. Supporting this, we found that cells expressing DGK zeta S/D had higher DAG levels and grew more rapidly compared with cells expressing DGK zeta S/N that could not be phosphorylated. Taken together, these results indicate that PKC alpha phosphorylates DGK zeta in cells, and this phosphorylation inhibits its kinase activity to remove cellular DAG, thereby affecting cell growth."}

UTI in premature infants can present with signs of sepsis: poor weight gain; temperature instability; metabolic acidosis; poor feeding; and abdominal distention. The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of routine urine culture as part of a sepsis evaluation in the preterm infants. We conducted a retrospective review of all infants with birth weight <1500 g (very low birth weight) who underwent sepsis evaluation at MetroHealth Medical Center between January 1991 and February 1998. All infants from whom urine and blood specimens were collected concomitantly for culture as part of a sepsis evaluation were included. Included were 538 infants. Their mean gestational age was 28.5 +/- 2.7 weeks, and mean birth weight was 1072 +/- 276 g. Blood and urine specimens for culture were taken from 349 infants on admission or in the first 24 h of life (Group A), their mean birth weight was 1147 +/- 244 g, and mean gestational age was 28.9 +/- 2.6 weeks. None of these infants had positive urine cultures; 8 infants (2%) had positive blood cultures. Blood and urine specimens were obtained from 189 infants later between Days 6 and 150 of life (Group B); their mean birth weight was 933 +/- 278 g, and mean gestational age was 27.5 +/- 2.5 weeks. Forty-eight infants (25.3%) in Group B had positive urine cultures, and 79 infants (41.7%) had positive blood cultures. Eighteen infants (38%) with positive urine cultures had positive blood cultures, and 30 infants (62%) had negative blood cultures. There is minimal benefit in obtaining urine cultures from very low birth weight infants as part of a sepsis evaluation in the first 24 h of life. It is important to obtain urine cultures from older infants with signs of sepsis to identify patients with UTI with or without bacteremia."}

The evidence for a sex difference in the risk of schizophrenia is inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to integrate results from the published literature and to provide a quantitative index of the male-female ratio for the incidence of schizophrenia. The MEDLINE and PsychLIT databases were searched for English-language publications on \"incidence and schizophrenia\" that appeared during the period between January 1980 and September 2001. Population-based incidence studies using standard clinical diagnostic criteria were included if they reported sex-specific incidence rates. Sex-specific incidence figures were extracted directly from each study. Categorical analyses were conducted on a subset of studies that met specific methodological criteria (to minimize criterion bias, hospital bias, and age bias). Study categorization and data extraction were performed independently by 2 of us (A. A. and J.-P.S.). Log risk ratio meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. The incidence risk ratios for men to develop schizophrenia relative to women were 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.56) when all studies were included in the analysis (49 effect sizes), 1.31 (95% CI, 1.13-1.51) when studies that minimized selection biases were analyzed separately (23 effect sizes), and 1.39 (95% CI, 1.15-1.68) when only high-quality studies were included (11 effect sizes). The sex difference was significantly smaller in studies with sample years before 1980 than those with sample years after 1980. No significant sex differences were reported in studies from developing countries. A final analysis, limited to studies with an age cutoff of 64 years or older (16 effect sizes), yielded a mean risk ratio of 1.32 (95% CI, 1.13-1.55). This meta-analysis provides evidence for a sex difference in the risk of developing schizophrenia, as reported in the published literature from the last 2 decades."}

Experimental data and the presence of sex hormone receptors suggest an important role of sex steroids in the regulation of the function of TMN neurons. Therefore, we investigated sex-, age- and Alzheimer-related changes in estrogen receptor alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta) in the TMN. In addition, metabolic activity changes of TMN neurons were determined by measuring Golgi apparatus (GA) and cell size. In the present study, ERalpha immunocytochemical expression in AD patients did not differ from that in elderly controls. However, a larger amount of cytoplasmic ERbeta was found in the TMN cells of AD patients. Earlier studies, using the GA size as a parameter, have shown a clearly decreased metabolic activity in the TMN neurons in AD. In the present study, the size of the GA did not change during aging, indicating the absence of strong metabolic changes. Cell size of the TMN neurons appeared to increase during normal aging in men but not in women. Concluding, the enhanced cytoplasmic expression of ERbeta in the TMN may be involved in the diminished neuronal metabolism of these neurons in AD patients."}

Studies of mice with tissue-specific ablation of Insr have indicated that both canonical (e.g. muscle and adipose tissue) and noncanonical (e.g. liver, pancreatic beta-cells, and brain) insulin target tissues can contribute to insulin resistance, albeit in a pathogenically distinct fashion. Furthermore, experimental crosses of Insr mutants with mice carrying mutations that affect insulin action at more distal steps of the insulin signaling cascade have begun to unravel the genetics of type 2 diabetes. These studies are consistent with an oligogenic inheritance, in which synergistic interactions among few alleles may account for the genetic susceptibility to diabetes. In addition to mutant alleles conferring an increased risk of diabetes, these studies have uncovered mutations that protect against insulin resistance, thus providing proof-of-principle for the notion that certain alleles may confer resistance to diabetes."}

After their first menstrual period, 30%-60% of American women suffer from some level of discomfort. It is estimated that 6 billion work hours are lost in this manner every year in the United States which equals an economic loss of nearly US$200 million. Dysmenorrhea is not only a problem for women but also one which affects quality of life and even reduces productivity in general. Dysmenorrhea is directly related to elevated levels of PGF2alpha (prostaglandins F2alpha) and is treated using nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs in Western medicine. Though efficacy of the latter is rapid, there are many side effects to the liver, kidney, and digestive system. The anti-inflammatory effect is temporary, and such drugs are unable to provide a long-term cure. Because of this, Chinese medicinal therapy is being considered as a feasible alternative medicine. In this study, Wen-Jing Tang (one of the dysmenorrhea Chinese medicinal prescriptions) was selected. A 50% alcoholic solution was used to extract active ingredients and create a freeze-dried product. At first, Wen-Jing Tang was used to suppress spontaneous contractions and prostaglandins F2alpha-induced contractions of rat uterine smooth muscle in vitro. Then, an assessment was performed to determine the mechanism of the prescription. Acetylcholine, ergonovine, propranolol, oxytocin, and KCl were used to analyze the physiological mechanisms of WJT. The results show that antagonism of both PGF2alpha and ACh are the major mechanisms for treating dysmenorrhea by Wen-Jing Tang. Furthermore, the antagonistic effect of KCl-depolarization contractions may be an auxiliary mechanism of the curative effect."}

Between June 1997 and March 2001, 90 patients suffering from uveal melanoma were treated at a LINAC with 6 MV. The head was immobilized with a modified stereotactic frame system (BrainLAB). For stabilization of the eye position a light source was integrated into the mask system in front of the healthy or the diseased eye. A mini-video camera was used for on-line eye movement control. Tumors included in the study were either located unfavorably with respect to macula and optical disc (<3 mm distance) or presented with a thickness >7 mm. Median tumor volume was 305+/-234 mm3 (range 70-1430 mm3), and mean tumor height was 5.4+/-2.3 mm (range 2.7-15.9 mm). Total doses of 70 (single dose 14 Gy @ 80% isodose) or 60 Gy (single dose 12 Gy @ 80% isodose) were applied in five fractions within 10 days. The first fractionation results in total dose (TD) (2 Gy) of 175 Gy for tumor and 238 Gy for normal tissue, corresponding values for the second fractionation schedule are 135 and 180 Gy, respectively. After a median follow-up of 20 months (range 1-48 months) local control was achieved in 98% (n=88). The mean relative tumor reductions were 24, 27, and 37% after 12, 24 and 36 months.

Our previous studies of p53(+) immortal HMEC lines indicated that overcoming the stringent replicative senescence step associated with critically short telomeres (agonescence), produced indefinite lifespan lines that maintained growth without immediately expressing telomerase activity. These telomerase(-) 'conditionally immortal' HMEC underwent an additional step, termed conversion, to become fully immortal telomerase(+) lines with uniform good growth. The very gradual conversion process was associated with slow heterogeneous growth and high expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57(Kip2). We now show that p53 suppresses telomerase activity and is necessary for the p57 expression in early passage p53(+) conditionally immortal HMEC lines, and that p53(-/-) lines exhibit telomerase reactivation and attain full immortality much more rapidly. A p53-inhibiting genetic suppressor element introduced into early passages of a conditionally immortal telomerase(-) p53(+) HMEC line led to rapid induction of hTERT mRNA, expression of telomerase activity, loss of p57 expression, and quick attainment of uniform good growth. These studies indicate that derangements in p53 function may impact malignant progression through direct effects on the conversion process, a potentially rate-limiting step in HMEC acquisition of uniform unlimited growth potential. These studies also provide evidence that the function of p53 in suppression of telomerase activity is separable from its cell cycle checkpoint function."}

The question is pertinent due to the recent detection of extragonadal expression of gonadotropin receptors. Western blotting, immunolocalization, and RT-PCR supported the presence of osteoblast LH receptors. However, osteoblast cells failed to bind [(125)I]hCG and treatment with hCG failed to generate either cAMP or phosphorylated ERK 1/2. Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone histomorphometry were examined in the following models: 1) LH receptor null mutant (LuRKO) mice; 2) transgenic mice overexpressing hCG (hCG alphabeta+); and 3) ovariectomized (OVX) hCG alphabeta+ model. Male LuRKO mice showed a decrease in BMD after 5 months, apparently secondary to suppressed gonadal steroid production. Similarly, 9- to 10-wk-old female LuRKO mice exhibited decreases in histomorphometric parameters tested. The data indicate that loss of LH signaling results in a reduction in bone formation or an increase in bone resorption. By contrast, there were significant increases in BMD and histomorphometric indices for female, but not male, hCG alphabeta+ mice, indicating that chronic exposure to hCG results in bone formation or a decrease in bone resorption. However, OVX of the hCG alphabeta+ mice resulted in a significant reduction in BMD comparable to OVX WT controls. Although gonadotropin levels are tightly linked to sex steroid titers, it appears that their effects on the skeleton are indirect."}

The rationally designed TAR* RNA hairpin with a loop sequence fully complementary to the TAR element, closed by U,A residues, also engages in a loop-loop association with TAR, but with a lower stability compared with the TAR-R06 complex. UV absorption monitored thermal denaturation showed that TAR-TAR*(GA), in which the U,A kissing residues were exchanged for G,A, is as stable as the selected TAR-R06 complex. Consequently, we used the TAR-TAR* structure deduced from NMR studies to model the TAR-R06 complex with either GA, CA or UA loop closing residues. The results of the molecular dynamics trajectories correlate well with the thermal denaturation experiments and show that the increased stability of the GA variant results from an optimized stacking of the bases at the stem-loop junction and from stable interbackbone hydrogen bonds."}

The SNs were localized intraoperatively with the aid of patent blue dye and using a hand-held gamma-probe. SNs were analyzed by serial sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin, with the adjacent section stained with anticytokeratin antibodies. Different parameters, such as the number of positive lymph nodes, presence of lymphovascular invasion, tumor size, tumor grade, histology (invasive vs. in situ), prior excisional biopsy, and patient age were analyzed to determine whether they had any significant correlation with nonvisualization of SNs in the axillary area. An axillary SN was successfully visualized on the preoperative lymphoscintigraphy in 302 of 332 patients (90.7%). No axillary drainage was found in 30 patients on the delayed images, even after a second injection of radiocolloid, and 5 of 30 patients showed uptake outside the axillary area. Positive nodes were identified in 86 of 302 patients (28.5%) with successful axillary drainage and in 19 of 30 patients (63.3%) with unsuccessful axillary drainage. More than 4 invaded axillary nodes (P < 0.0001) and the presence of lymphovascular invasion in the breast tumor (P = 0.004) were the only significant variables on univariate analysis, although multivariate analysis showed that only the increased number of invaded nodes was statistically significant. Patients with unsuccessful axillary mapping have an increased risk for axillary involvement."}

We show that one of penetratins, the basic domain 47-57 of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, transcription factor Tat (Tat peptide), is able to interact with plasmid DNA electrostatically. These interactions result in formation of polyelectrolytic complexes at various negative/positive charge ratios of plasmid DNA and Tat peptide. Plasmid DNA is capable of binding to Tat peptide up to 1.7-fold excess of the complex positive charge. The DNA-Tat complexes can be used for delivery of plasmid DNA into mammalian cells. Transfection efficacy of cultured cells by DNA-Tat complexes is stimulated by free Tat peptide, most likely because it protects DNA-Tat complexes from disruption by anionic proteoglycans of cellular surface. Our data strongly argue in favor of the endocytosis-dependent mechanism of DNA-Tat complex uptake by mammalian cells similarly to internalization of complexes of plasmid DNA with other polycationic carriers. Moreover, different cell lines use different endocytosis-mediated pathways for DNA-Tat complex internalization. Intravenous injections to mice of DNA-Tat complexes in comparison with injections of naked DNA showed an inhibitory effect of DNA-Tat complex positive charge on expression of transferred gene. A low level of foreign gene expression in the liver of mice injected intravenously with positively charged DNA-Tat complexes is accounted for by inactivation of DNA-Tat complexes in the bloodstream due to their interactions with serum albumin. These data should be taken into account in an attempt to develop versatile gene delivery systems based on penetratin application for human disease therapy."}

Overexpression of GDH2 increased ethanol yield from 0.43 to 0.51 mol of carbon (Cmol) Cmol(-1), mainly by reducing xylitol excretion by 44%. Overexpression of the GS-GOGAT complex did not improve conversion of xylose to ethanol during batch cultivation, but it increased ethanol yield by 16% in carbon-limited continuous cultivation at a low dilution rate."}

We compared follow-up after tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy of atopic and nonatopic children.Study design and setting A prospective study of 293 children consecutively undergoing tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy was conducted at a university hospital center. Preoperative and postoperative (1-year follow-up) allergy-related symptom scores were obtained by parents. Intraoperative total serum IgE, the screening test sx1 (Pharmacia), and, if positive, serum specific IgE to inhalative allergens were carried out. Sixty-seven children (22.9%) showed positive RAST results to inhalative allergens (class 1 to 6). In both sensitized and nonsensitized groups, the general health was improved in more than 89% at 1 year postoperatively. No significant difference of postoperative nasal symptoms between the atopic and nonatopic groups was found. Both atopic and nonatopic children with adenotonsillar disease improve health after adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy. In our opinion, routine allergy tests before adenotonsillectomy or adenoidectomy are not justified. Only if allergy is suspected due to clinical findings or family history should an allergy test be carried out."}

Many innocent victims were persecuted and even tried as witches as the medical community struggled to arrive at a better understanding of Huntington's disease. The contributions, before and after Huntington's essay, that have led to a better understanding of adult onset hereditary chorea are examined in this paper. A review is undertaken of the American and international medical literature including articles, books, and journals. The impact of Huntington's original essay is discussed in detail. The history of adult onset chorea dates back to the Middle Ages when descriptions were vague, and sufferers were persecuted. Nineteenth century doctors recognized and reported the distinct entity of adult onset hereditary chorea. Perhaps with the help of an expanded life expectancy, George Huntington described the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern as well as other characteristic features of the disease. Later, distinctive phenotypes and the juvenile form were reported. The modern history of the disease remained relatively quiescent until the discovery of the causative gene in 1983. This discovery marked a new era in the history of adult onset chorea. Accurate descriptions before and after Huntington's essay about hereditary chorea have provided humanity to sufferers and the nidus for new discovery within the field of movement disorders."}

A group of inpatients at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, as identified by the primary unit, were sampled to measure serum vitamin D and parameters of bone turnover. A second group of disabled children (outpatients) were also measured to establish vitamin D status. Of the total population, 54.9% were found to have low serum 25 hydroxy (25OH) vitamin D levels. Of the inpatient group, 25.4% were vitamin D deficient (<30 nM/L), and 27.1% were vitamin D insufficient (30-50 nM/L). The mean 25OH vitamin D was 52.1 nM/L. Of the outpatient group, 15.4% were vitamin D deficient, whilst 42.3% were found to be insufficient. The mean vitamin D level was 41.2 nM/L. No difference attributable to intellectual versus physical disability was found. Anticonvulsant use and ambulatory status was not predictive of vitamin D status in the children examined. Of the total population, 0.05% were found to have secondary hyperparathyroidism. The mean 25OH vitamin D level of this subgroup was 30.6 nM/L. Dark skin tone was found to be significantly associated with hypovitaminosis D (P = 0.001), where all five children with dark skin tone were found to have serum 25OH vitamin D levels <50 nM/L. Of the seven disabled children (outpatients) found to be iron deficient, four had coexistent hypovitaminosis D. The percentage prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is high in both chronically ill, and physically/intellectually disabled children in Melbourne, Australia. Increased vigilance and recognition of this deficiency state is needed as an important health prevention strategy."}

RA inhibits chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells and also causes loss of differentiated chondrocyte phenotype. The present study investigated the mechanisms underlying RA regulation of chondrogenesis. RA treatment in chondrifying mesenchymal cells did not affect precartilage condensation, but blocked progression from precartilage condensation to cartilage nodule formation. This inhibitory effect of RA was independent of protein kinase C and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, which are positive and negative regulators of cartilage nodule formation, respectively. The progression from precartilage condensation to cartilage nodule requires downregulation of N-cadherin expression. However, RA treatment caused sustained expression of N-cadherin and its associated proteins including alpha- and beta-catenin suggesting that modulation of expression of these molecules is associated with RA-induced inhibition of chondrogenesis. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D (CD) blocks RA-induced sustained expression of cell adhesion molecules and overcomes RA-induced inhibition of chondrogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest RA inhibits chondrogenesis by stabilizing cell-to-cell interactions at the post-precartilage condensation stage."}

To determine whether these two traits are influenced by genetic background and are dependent on each other, mice carrying the Cx50 deletion in two different strains were generated, and the growth defect and severity of cataracts were analyzed. Cx50-knockout mice were generated in the 129S6 strain, and back-crossed into the C57BL/6J genetic background. To analyze the influence of genetic background on the observed phenotype, postnatal lens growth, lens clarity, lens histology and crystallin solubility were determined and compared between the two strains of Cx50-knockout mice. The growth deficiency persisted, regardless of genetic background, but genetic modifiers that differentially altered the solubility of crystallin proteins influenced the severity of cataracts. Expression levels of Cx46 were similar in all animals, regardless of genetic background, indicating that the differences were not due to a compensatory upregulation of Cx46. Taken together, these data indicate that the two components of the Cx50 phenotype are independent of each other and that cataractogenesis is under the influence of an unidentified genetic modifier."}
{"pmid": "12969359", "title": "Effect of rhBMP-2 on guided bone regeneration in humans.", "abstract": "The aim of the present clinical study was to test whether or not the addition of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) to a xenogenic bone substitute mineral (Bio-Oss) will improve guided bone regeneration therapy regarding bone volume, density and maturation. In 11 partially edentulous patients, 34 Brånemark implants were placed at two different sites in the same jaw (five maxillae, six mandibles) requiring lateral ridge augmentation. The bone defects were randomly assigned to test and control treatments: the test and the control defects were both augmented with the xenogenic bone substitute and a resorbable collagen membrane (Bio-Gide). At the test sites, the xenogenic bone substitute mineral was coated with rhBMP-2 in a lyophilization process. Following implant insertion (baseline), the peri-implant bone defect height was measured from the implant shoulder to the first implant-bone contact. After an average healing period of 6 months (SD 0.17, range 5.7-6.2), the residual defects were again measured and trephine burs were used to take 22 bone biopsies from the augmented regions. The healing period was uneventful except for one implant site that showed a wound dehiscence, which spontaneously closed after 4 weeks. Later at reentry, all implants were stable. At baseline, the mean defect height was 7.0 mm (SD 2.67, range 3-12 mm) at test and 5.8 mm (SD 1.81, range 3-8 mm) at control sites. At reentry, the mean defect height decreased to 0.2 mm (SD 0.35, range 0-1 mm) at test sites (corresponding to 96% vertical defect fill) and to 0.4 mm (SD 0.66, range 0-2 mm) at the control site (vertical defect fill of 91%). Reduction in defect height from baseline to reentry for both test and control sites was statistically significant (Wilcoxon P<0.01). Histomorphometric analysis showed an average area density of 37% (SD 11.2, range 23-51%) newly formed bone at test sites and 30% (SD 8.9, range 18-43%) at control sites. The fraction of mineralized bone identified as mature lamellar bone amounted to 76% (SD 14.4, range 47.8-94%) at test compared to 56% (SD 18.3, range 31.6-91.4%) at control sites (paired t-test P<0.05). At BMP-treated sites 57% (SD 16.2, range 29-81%) and at control sites 30% (SD 22.6, range 0-66%) of the surface of the bone substitute particles were in direct contact with newly formed bone (paired t-test P<0.05). It is concluded that the combination of the xenogenic bone substitute mineral with rhBMP-2 can enhance the maturation process of bone regeneration and can increase the graft to bone contact in humans. rhBMP-2 has the potential to predictably improve and accelerate guided bone regeneration therapy."}

Groups of 35 rats and 34-36 mice of each sex were administered estradiol mustard at one of the following doses, either 0.62 or 1.25 mg/kg body weight for rats and either 15 or 30 mg/kg body weight for mice. The vehicle used for the test chemical consisted of 0.05% polysorbate 80 in phosphate-buffered saline. The rats and mice were dosed three times per week for 52 weeks, then observed for an additional 30-34 weeks. Controls consisted of groups of 10 rats and 15 mice of each sex that were not administered the chemical (untreated controls) and also of groups of 10 rats of each sex, 14 male mice, and 16 female mice administered the vehicle alone (vehicle controls). Pooled controls were also used. All surviving rats were killed at 84-86 weeks and all surviving mice at 82-86 weeks. Mean body weights of male rats and male and female mice administered estradiol mustard were lower throughout the greater part of the study than those of corresponding vehicle or untreated controls; mean body weights of dosed female rats were unaffected. Administration of the test chemical had no significant effect on the survival of either male or female rats. A large number of dosed mice died prior to the end of the study. The numbers of dosed male mice which were at risk as long as 52 weeks were sufficient, however, for development of tumors appearing up to that time. Time-adjusted analysis and life-table analyses were applied to data obtained with the mice. In rats, no tumors were observed in a statistically significant incidence in the animals administered estradiol mustard. In mice, lymphoma or lymphocytic leukemia occurred at significant incidences in low-dose (P=0.018) and high-dose (P<0.001) groups of males compared with those in the pooled vehicle controls (controls 0/28, low-dose 6/32, high-dose 17/29) and at significant incidences in low-dose (P=0.020) and high-dose (P=0.002) groups of females compared with those in the corresponding vehicle controls (controls 0/14, low-dose 9/30, high-dose 11/23). In addition, the incidences of lymphoma were statistically significant for dose-related trend for both the males (P<0.001) and the females (P=0.003). Since lymphoma was observed in male mice as early as 25 weeks, life-table analyses of the incidence in each sex were performed. The results indicated a dose association (P=0.001) between the administration of estradiol mustard and the time of observation of lymphoma in either sex of mice. In mice, alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma occurred at a significant incidence (P=0.004) in the low-dose group of males compared with the pooled vehicle controls (controls 2/28, low-dose 12/30, high-dose 5/24) and at a significant incidence (P=0.022) in the low-dose group of females compared with the pooled vehicle controls (controls 1/28, low-dose 7/27, high-dose 1/18). Sarcoma of the myocardium similarly occurred at a significant incidence (P=0.015) in the low-dose group of males compared with the pooled vehicle controls (controls 0/28, low-dose 6/30, high-dose 2/24) and at a significant incidence (P=0.002) in the low-dose group of females compared with the pooled vehicle controls (controls 0/28, low-dose 8/27, high-dose 1/12). The survival of both high-dose males and high-dose females was slightly lower than that of the respective low-dose groups and may account for the higher numbers of pulmonary tumors and myocardial sarcomas among low-dose mice of both sexes. The association of myocardial sarcoma with administration of the chemical in both dosed groups of each sex is strengthened by the fact that these tumors of the myocardium have not occurred in the more than 500 male and 500 female historical-control mice of this strain at the laboratory. Squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach occurred in the dosed male mice (high-dose 2/29) and in the dosed female mice (low-dose 2/26, high-dose 2/14) but was absent in all controls. Although the incidences in this bioassay were too low to be statistically significant, the fact that no squamous-cell carcinomas of the stomach have occurred in the more than 500 male and 500 female historical-control mice of this strain at this laboratory indicates that these gastric tumors were related to the administration of the estradiol mustard. It is concluded that under the conditions of this bioassay, estradiol mustard administered in a buffered saline vehicle was not carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats. Estradiol mustard was carcinogenic in both male and female B6C3F1 mice, inducing lymphoma, sarcoma of the myocardium, alveolar adenoma or carcinoma, and squamous-cell carcinoma of the stomach.

Previous research suggests that patients with schizophrenia exhibit temporal perception deficits on both auditory and visual stimuli. The current study investigated the effects of interval manipulation to (1) replicate the original findings with a larger sample and an increased number of trials (2) assess the degree to which both patients and controls can differentiate temporal changes in a range of experimental interstimulus intervals, and (3) explore whether different interstimulus interval durations pose different levels of difficulty for the patients with schizophrenia. Participants were asked to decide whether temporal intervals were shorter or longer than standard intervals on a computer-based auditory temporal perception task. The standard interval remained the same duration throughout the various tasks. The interstimulus interval separating the standard and experimental intervals varied in the range of 500, 1000, or 3000 ms. Data are presented for a sample of 16 patients with schizophrenia and 15 controls. Data suggest that patients with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in differentiating interval durations across all paradigms compared to their control-group peers on a range of auditory tasks (p<.001). These results are consistent with a general temporal deficit in schizophrenia. However, the roles of medication and localization are also addressed."}

One hundred and sixty-five parents of children with oral clefts, ascertained from a craniofacial clinic in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, answered a 151-item semistructured questionnaire. The questionnaire included sections covering sociodemographic information, level of religiousness, characteristics of the child's cleft, parental perception of their child's cleft, pregnancy history, recurrence risk, access to health care, attitudes in regard to abortion, and family environment. Most parents (60%) believe their child's cleft is not a serious condition. None of the respondents would terminate a pregnancy because the ultrasound reveals an oral cleft. Similarly, very few (6.1%) would terminate the pregnancy if there were an early diagnosis of Down syndrome. Half of the respondents believe that abortion should not be an option for any couple expecting a child. Most respondents do not perceive oral clefts as a severe condition. Parents would not choose to terminate the pregnancy over delivery of such an affected newborn."}

Chondrocyte sub-populations were seeded separately in agarose constructs and cultured unstrained, within a 24-well tissue culture plate, for 48 h in medium supplemented with IL-1 beta and/or L-N-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO). In a separate experiment, superficial and deep cell containing constructs were subjected to 15% dynamic compressive strain at 1 Hz, for 48 h, in the presence or absence of IL-1 beta and/or L-NIO. Nitrite was measured using the Griess assay, PGE(2)release was determined using an EIA kit and [3H]-thymidine and 35SO(4)incorporation were assessed by TCA and alcian blue precipitation, respectively. The current data reveal that IL-1 beta significantly enhanced *NO and PGE(2)release for superficial chondrocytes, an effect reversed with L-NIO. *NO and PGE(2)levels did not significantly change by deep cells in the presence of IL-1 beta and/or L-NIO. For both cell sub-populations, IL-1 beta inhibited cell proliferation whereas proteoglycan synthesis was not affected. Dynamic compression inhibited the release of *NO and PGE(2)in the presence and absence of IL-1 beta, for cells from both sub-populations. L-NIO reduced *NO and enhanced PGE(2)release for superficial zone chondrocytes, an effect not observed for deep cells in response to dynamic compression. The magnitude of stimulation of [3H]-thymidine incorporation was similar for both cell sub-populations and was not influenced by L-NIO, indicating an z.rad;NO-independent pathway. The dynamic compression-induced stimulation of 35SO(4)incorporation was enhanced with L-NIO for IL-1 beta-stimulated deep cells, indicating an *NO-dependent pathway. The present findings suggest that dynamic compression inhibits *NO and PGE(2)release in IL-1 beta-stimulated superficial cells via distinct pathways, a significant finding that may contribute to the development of intervention strategies for the treatment of inflammatory joint disorders."}

Moreover, yellow F2 mice (F2-Ay) exhibit a wide spectrum of coat color phenotypes in terms of lightness and darkness. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis on F2-Ay identified three significant modifier loci that accounted for darkening of the coat color on chromosomes 1 (Dmyaq1 and Dmyaq2) and 15 (Dmyaq3), and the C3H/HeJ allele at these loci increased the darkness. Because agouti F2 mice (F2-A) also exhibited a spectrum of coat color phenotypes, the question of whether these QTLs had any effects on F2-A was examined. Dmyaq1 and Dmyaq2 were shown to increase the darkness in F2-A, whereas Dmyaq3 did not. The results showed that Dmyaq1-Dmyaq3 were parts of determinants responsible for the sable (darker modification of yellow) coat color phenotype, and that Dmyaq1 and Dmyaq2 were parts of determinants responsible for the umbrous (darker modification of agouti) coat color phenotype. It is, thus, demonstrated that both the sable and the umbrous phenotypes resulted from multigenic contributions, and that they shared genetic bases, as had been implied for several decades."}

In Study 1, fear was assessed by using 2 standard temperament questionnaires and a laboratory-based, standardized stranger approach. Individual differences in cognitive development were assessed using the Object Permanence Scale of the Infant Psychological Development Scales (I. C. Uzgiris & J. M. Hunt, 1975). All 3 assessments of fear significantly predicted object permanence performance, with correlations ranging from -.32 to -.35. In Study 2, fear was assessed via a maternal report questionnaire, and habituation performance was assessed via a basic-level categorization task. Familiarity with the examiner and with the testing environment was manipulated to test for a familiarity influence on performance. Testing revealed individual differences in both fear and habituation. Results suggest that highly fearful infants required more trials to habituate and were less likely to meet the habituation criterion than infants who were less fearful.

Whether the effects of IL-1beta were mediated through a prostaglandin pathway and whether IL-1beta induced the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 was also examined. Single- and double-labeling immunohistochemistry was used after treatment of isolated tissues with IL-1beta (0.1-10 ng/ml). IL-1beta induced Fos expression in enteric neurons and also in enteric glia in the ileum and colon. For enteric neurons, activation was concentration-dependent and sensitive to indomethacin, in both the myenteric and submucosal plexuses in both regions of the gut. The maximum proportion of activated neurons differed between the ileal (approximately 15%) and colonic (approximately 42%) myenteric and ileal (approximately 60%) and colonic (approximately 75%) submucosal plexuses. The majority of neurons activated in the myenteric plexus of the ileum expressed nitric oxide synthase (NOS) or enkephalin immunoreactivity. In the colon, activated myenteric neurons expressed NOS. In the submucosal plexus of both regions of the gut, the majority of activated neurons were vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) immunoreactive. After treatment with IL-1beta, COX-2 immunoreactivity was detected in the wall of the gut in both neurons and nonneuronal cells. In conclusion, we have found that the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta specifically activates certain neurochemically defined neural pathways and that these changes may lead to disturbances in motility observed in the inflamed bowel."}

The most common type of gastric cancer, the intestinal type, is usually preceded by chronic atrophic gastritis. Gastritis serology is therefore of crucial importance for population-based screening and prevention studies. Helicobacter pylori serum antibodies can adequately diagnose inflammation of the gastric mucosa, but the serological diagnosis of atrophic gastritis is more hazardous. Many tests have been used for this purpose, either alone or in various combinations. Depending on the population, pepsinogens and gastrin often have a high specificity but low sensitivity for the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis, whereas antibodies against H. pylori or CagA have a high sensitivity but low specificity. A combination of two tests, e.g. H. pylori antibodies and pepsinogen I, may balance this issue and provide adequate screening tools, although there is a clear need for further improvement and simplification of serological testing for atrophic gastritis."}

There is a paucity of data evaluating the use of melatonin in TD. Both of the controlled studies evaluating its use are limited by methodologic issues. Although the most recent trial did report a statistically significant improvement in TD with melatonin, these results are not considered to be clinically significant. There are inadequate data at the present time to support the use of melatonin in patients with TD."}
{"pmid": "12880996", "title": "Gastroesophageal reflux: comparison of barium studies with 24-h pH monitoring.", "abstract": "To determine the correlation between massive gastroesophageal reflux (GER) on barium studies and pathologic acid reflux on 24-h pH monitoring. A search of hospital records from January 1997 to January 2001 revealed 28 patients who underwent both barium studies and 24-h pH monitoring. The radiologic reports were reviewed to determine the presence and degree of GER. Patients with reflux to or above the thoracic inlet either spontaneously or with provocative maneuvers in the recumbent position were classified as having massive reflux, whereas the remaining patients with reflux below the thoracic inlet or no reflux comprised the control group. The pH monitoring reports were also reviewed to determine if pathologic acid reflux was present in the recumbent position. The findings on these studies were then compared to determine the frequency of pathologic acid reflux in the recumbent position on pH monitoring in patients with massive reflux on barium studies compared with the control group. Massive GER was observed on barium studies in 11 (39%) of the 28 patients and reflux below the thoracic inlet or no reflux in the remaining 17 patients (61%) who comprised the control group. All 11 patients (100%) with massive reflux on barium studies had pathologic acid reflux on pH monitoring in the recumbent position compared with six (35%) of 17 patients in the control group (P = 0.0009). The pH in the distal esophagus on pH monitoring was less than 4.0 for 13.1% of the recumbent period for patients with massive GER on barium studies compared with 6.2% of the recumbent period for the control group (P = 0.0076). Although 24-h pH monitoring remains the gold standard for the detection of GER, our experience suggests that patients with massive reflux on barium studies are so likely to have pathologic acid reflux in the recumbent position that these individuals can be further evaluated and treated for their gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) without need for pH monitoring."}
{"pmid": "12942852", "title": "[The relative pharmacokinetics of two oral formulations of chlormadinone acetate: Lutéran 5mg. and Lutéran tablet 10 mg].", "abstract": "The bioavailability of a new formulation of chlormadinone acetate (one 10 mg Lutéran tablet) was compared with that of the reference formulation (two 5 mg Lutéran tablets) in a randomised crossover open trial after single oral administration of a 10 mg dose to 12 healthy female volunteers. Measurements of chlormadinone acetate plasma samples were performed by combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Blood samples were collected before administration and up to 144 hours after administration. No significant difference was found between the two formulations in pharmacokinetic parameters. The bioavailability of the two formulations was equivalent in terms of time to maximum concentration (tmax [mean tmax about 2.5 h]) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) [Weslake's symmetric confidence interval: 19.24%, Schuirmann two one-sided tests procedure: p < 0.05]. No difference was found between the two formulations with regard to clinical safety parameters."}
